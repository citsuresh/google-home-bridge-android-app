This document outlines how to build and run the Google Home APIs for Android sample app.
### Prerequisites
**To build and install:**
*   Android Studio 2024.2.1 ("Ladybug") or later.
*   Android debugger (`adb`).
**To test the Home APIs:**
*   An Android device (Android 10+) with a developer Google Account.
*   A Wi-Fi network.
*   A [Google hub that supports the Home APIs](/apis/android/sdk#supported_hubs) is required to control Matter devices.
*   At least one supported device. If using Thread, the hub must be a Thread border router. The sample app supports:
    *   Color Temperature Light (on/off, brightness)
    *   Contact Sensor (boolean state)
    *   Dimmable Light (on/off, brightness)
    *   Extended Color Light (on/off, brightness)
    *   Generic Switch
    *   Occupancy Sensor (occupancy sensing)
    *   On/Off Light (on/off, brightness)
    *   On/Off Light Switch
    *   On/Off Plug-in Unit (on/off)
    *   On/Off Sensor
### Download the Source Code
The [source code](https://github.com/google-home/google-home-api-sample-app-android) is available on GitHub.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/google-home/google-home-api-sample-app-android.git
```
### Set up the SDK
The Home APIs for Android are in open beta and not yet in standard Google libraries. You must download and host the libraries locally.
> **Note:** You must be [signed into Google Home Developers](/_d/signin?continue=https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/sample-app/build&prompt=select_account) to download the SDK.
### Build and Configure the App
1.  **Open Project**: In Android Studio, open the cloned `google-home-api-sample-app-android` project. The initial Gradle sync may take up to 10 minutes. If it fails, click **Try Again**.
2.  **Connect Device**: Connect a physical Android phone with ADB enabled.
    > **Note:** A real Android phone is recommended over an emulator, as the Home APIs rely on Google Play services.
3.  **Change Package Name**:
    1.  In the project hierarchy, right-click the `com.example` package and select **Refactor** > **Rename...**.
    2.  Enter your new package name.
    3.  In `build.gradle.kts`, update the `android namespace` and `applicationId` to match the new package name.
4.  **Generate Debug Certificate**: Run the app from Android Studio to automatically generate a debug certificate. Stop the app after it builds and installs.
5.  **Get SHA-1 Fingerprint**: Get your debug certificate's SHA-1 fingerprint by following the instructions for [Android native applications](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549257#zippy=%2Cstep-create-a-new-client-secret%2Cstep-configure-your-app-to-use-the-new-secret%2Cnative-applications-android-ios-desktop-uwp-chrome-extensions-tv-and-limited-input%2Candroid:%7E:text=input%20device%20flow.-,Android,-Note%3A%20Currently%2C%20obtaining).
    > **Tip:** To find the `debug.keystore` location in Android Studio 2024.2.1+:
    > 1.  In **Settings** > **Experimental**, enable **Configure all Gradle tasks during Gradle Sync**.
    > 2.  In the Gradle Tool Window, run the `signingReport` task (`app` > `tasks` > `android` > `signingReport`).
    > 3.  The keystore location is shown on the **Store** line in the report panel.
### Set up OAuth
#### 1. Configure Consent Screen
1.  In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/home/dashboard), select your project.
2.  Go to **APIs and Services** > **Credentials**.
3.  If prompted, click **Configure consent screen**.
    1.  Select user type (**Internal** or **External**) and click **Create**.
    2.  Fill in the **App information**.
    3.  On the **Scopes** page, click **Save and continue** without adding scopes.
    4.  On the **Test users** page, click **+ ADD USERS** and add your test user's email address.
    5.  Review the summary and return to the dashboard.
    > For full details, see [Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615#user-type&zippy=%2Ctesting%2Cexternal%2Cinternal).
#### 2. Create OAuth Credentials
1.  Follow the guide for [Setting up OAuth 2.0](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849).
2.  Set the application type to **native/Android app**.
3.  Add the SHA-1 fingerprint you obtained earlier to the OAuth client configuration.
### Run the App
With your mobile device connected, click **Run project** in Android Studio. The app will install on your device as **Home API Sample App**.

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/sample-app/authorization

# Account Authorization on Android
## Prerequisites
*   The Google Home app (GHA) installed on your Android device, with at least one home (structure) set up on your Google Account.
*   At least one supported device type in the home:
    *   Color Temperature Light
    *   Contact Sensor
    *   Dimmable Light
    *   Extended Color Light
    *   Generic Switch
    *   Occupancy Sensor
    *   On/Off Light
    *   On/Off Light Switch
    *   On/Off Plug-in Unit
    *   On/Off Sensor
*   Two devices for testing the sample automation.
**Note:** Devices must be controllable from GHA before they can be used through the Home APIs.
## Run the Android Sample App
When you first run the sample app, it will request permission to access and control the structures and devices in a home on your Google Account. The permission behavior depends on the app's registration status.
**Important:** The Google Home Developer Console is not yet available for registration.
### Unverified App (Not Registered)
This is the default state and is recommended for testing.
*   **Permissions:** Only users registered as test users in the OAuth console (limit of 100) can grant permissions.
*   **Device Access:** Access is granted to all devices of any supported type within a structure.
### Verified App (Registered)
This state is required for production launch after an app is registered, approved for device types, and has completed brand verification for OAuth.
*   **Permissions:** Any user can grant permission; test user limits do not apply.
*   **Device Access:** Users can only grant permission for the specific device types approved in the Developer Console.
### Authorization Flow
1.  Tap **Allow access to a chosen home**.
2.  **If you have homes connected to your account:**
    *   Choose a home to grant permission to.
    *   If no devices are found in the selected home, you can either:
        *   Tap **Allow access to another home**.
        *   Set up a supported device in that home using the GHA.
3.  **If you have no homes connected to your account:**
    *   You will see the message: "There are no structures for the selected account."
    *   Return to the main app view, set up a home using GHA, and then try again.
The permissions flow can be revisited at any time by selecting the profile icon (`account_circle`) in the app.
After successfully granting permission, you will be taken to the devices view where you can control them and observe their state changes.

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/oauth

# Set up OAuth for your Android app
The Home APIs use OAuth 2.0 to grant app access to devices without exposing user login credentials. If you have an existing verified OAuth client, you can use it for testing.
## 1. Sign the App & Get SHA-1 Fingerprint
First, generate a debug certificate by running your app in Android Studio.
1.  Connect your mobile device and run the app from Android Studio to build and install it.
2.  Stop the running app.
3.  Get the debug certificate's SHA-1 fingerprint by following the instructions on the [Google Cloud Console Help site](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849#zippy=%2Cnative-applications%2Candroid:%7E:text=input%20device%20flow.-,Android,-Note%3A%20Currently%2C%20obtaining).
> **Tip:** To find the `debug.keystore` location in Android Studio 2024.2.1 ('Ladybug') or later:
> 1. In **Settings** > **Experimental**, enable **Configure all Gradle tasks during Gradle Sync**.
> 2. Open the Gradle Tool Window.
> 3. Run the **signingReport** task located under **app** > **tasks** > **android**.
> 4. The report in the lower panel will show the keystore file location.
## 2. Set up the OAuth Consent Screen
1.  In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/home/dashboard), select your project.
2.  Go to **APIs and Services** > **Credentials**.
3.  If prompted, click **Configure consent screen**.
    1.  Select user type (**Internal** or **External**) and click **Create**.
    2.  Enter the required app information.
    3.  You do not need to add any scopes.
    4.  Under **Test users**, click **+ ADD USERS** and enter your test user's email address.
    5.  Review the summary and return to the dashboard.
For full details, see [Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615#user-type&zippy=%2Ctesting%2Cexternal%2Cinternal).
## 3. Register the App and Create Credentials
Register your app for OAuth 2.0 by following the instructions in [Setting up OAuth 2.0](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849).
*   Select the app type as **native/Android app**.
*   Add the SHA-1 fingerprint you obtained earlier to the OAuth client configuration.
## Using an Existing OAuth Client
You can use an existing, verified OAuth client from a published app to test the Home APIs.
*   **Developer Console Registration:** While not required for testing, you must complete Google Home Developer Console registration to publish your app.
*   **User Limit:** There is a 100-user limit when testing with an existing client. This limit is lifted upon completion of Developer Console registration.
*   **Device Grants:** Developer Console registration is necessary to restrict device-type grants via OAuth for your production app.
**Important:** The Google Home Developer Console is not yet available for registration.
Apps pending OAuth verification cannot complete the auth flow and will show an error:
```
Access blocked: <Project Name> has not completed the Google verification process.
```

# Initialize the Home on Android
Before using any Home APIs for Android, you must initialize a **singleton** instance of `Home`. This is the entry point to the APIs and requires declaring which traits and device types your app will use.
**Important: Only one instance of `Home` should be active at a time.**
### Create a Home instance
**1. Required Imports**
```kotlin
import android.content.Context
import com.google.home.FactoryRegistry
import com.google.home.HomeConfig
import com.google.home.Home
```
**2. Initialization Steps**
1.  **Get Application Context**
    Get a reference to the `Application` context, which is not dependent on any activity lifecycle.
    ```kotlin
    val context = Context.getApplicationContext()
    ```
2.  **Create a `FactoryRegistry`**
    Create an instance with all the traits and device types your app will use. See [Registration of traits and device types](#registration-of-traits-and-device-types) for more details.
    *Example:*
    ```kotlin
    val registry = FactoryRegistry(
      traits = listOf(
                AirQuality, AreaAttendanceState, AreaPresenceState, AssistantBroadcast,
                AssistantFulfillment, BooleanState, ColorControl, ExtendedColorControl,
                FlowMeasurement, IlluminanceMeasurement, LevelControl, Notification,
                OccupancySensing, OnOff, RelativeHumidityMeasurement, Switch,
                TemperatureMeasurement, Thermostat),
      types = listOf(
                AirQualitySensorDevice, ColorDimmerSwitchDevice, ColorTemperatureLightDevice,
                ContactSensorDevice, DimmableLightDevice, DimmablePlugInUnitDevice,
                DimmerSwitchDevice, ExtendedColorLightDevice, FlowSensorDevice,
                GenericSwitchDevice, HumiditySensorDevice, LightSensorDevice,
                OccupancySensorDevice, OnOffLightDevice, OnOffLightSwitchDevice,
                OnOffPluginUnitDevice, OnOffSensorDevice, SpeakerDevice,
                TemperatureSensorDevice, ThermostatDevice))
    ```
    *Note: You must add import statements for each individual trait and device type registered here.*
3.  **Instantiate `HomeConfig`**
    Use the [`Dispatchers.IO`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-dispatchers/#-978510185%2FProperties%2F-1316292404) coroutine context and your registry instance.
    ```kotlin
    val homeConfig = HomeConfig(
            coroutineContext = Dispatchers.IO,
            factoryRegistry = registry)
    ```
4.  **Create the `Home` Singleton**
    Create the singleton instance of `Home`, which is the entry point to the APIs.
    ```kotlin
    val homeManager: HomeClient = Home.getClient(context, homeConfig)
    ```
### Singleton Implementation Example
To avoid errors with invalid sessions, it is important to create only a **singleton** instance of `Home`, for example by wrapping it in an [object declaration](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html).
*Sample App Example:*
```kotlin
internal object HomeClientModule {
  @Provides
  @Singleton
  fun provideHomeClient(@ApplicationContext context: Context): HomeClient {
    return Home.getClient(
      context,
      HomeConfig(
        coroutineContext = IODispatcherModule.provideIoDispatcher(),
        factoryRegistry = registry,
      ),
    )
  }
}
```
### Registration of traits and device types
*   The `FactoryRegistry` class helps optimize your app's binary size by letting you explicitly declare which traits and device types are used.
*   Permissions and the factory registry are decoupled.
*   Traits and types that are available to your app via permissions but are **not** included in the factory registry will be inaccessible using the Automation API and will not be returned in bulk `traits()` or `types()` method calls.

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/permissions

# Permissions API on Android
Before using Home APIs, an app needs permission to access devices in the user's home (the *structure*). The Permissions API handles this user consent flow. Permission grants are made on a structure-by-structure basis.
## Integrate the Permissions API
**Prerequisite:** Initialize the `homeManager` instance as described in the Android initialization guide.
First, register an `ActivityResultCaller` with the SDK.
```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    homeManager.registerActivityResultCallerForPermissions(this)
  }
```
### Check for Permissions
Check if the user has already granted consent using `homeManager.hasPermissions()`. This returns a `Flow` of `PermissionsState` values.
```kotlin
val permissionsReadyState =
  homeManager.hasPermissions().collect { state ->
    when (state) {
      PermissionsState.GRANTED -> println("Permissions granted.")
      PermissionsState.PERMISSIONS_STATE_UNAVAILABLE -> println("State unavailable, request permissions.")
      PermissionsState.NOT_GRANTED -> println("Not granted yet, request permissions.")
      else -> // Handle unexpected state
  }
}
```
- If the state is `NOT_GRANTED` or `PERMISSIONS_STATE_UNAVAILABLE`, the app or user lacks access.
- If the state is `GRANTED` but a call to `structures()` returns none, the user may have revoked access via the Google Home app (GHA) or lacks the required access.
### Request Permissions
If permissions are not granted, use `homeManager.requestPermissions()` to launch the Permissions UI. An application can only be granted permission to one structure at a time.
**Prerequisite:** OAuth must be set up for the Permissions UI to launch.
```kotlin
fun requestPermissions(scope: CoroutineScope) {
  scope.launch {
    val result =
      try {
        homeManager.requestPermissions()
      } catch (e: HomeException) {
        // Handle exception
      }
    when (result.status) {
      PermissionsResultStatus.SUCCESS -> Log.i(TAG, "Permissions successfully granted.")
      PermissionsResultStatus.CANCELLED -> Log.i(TAG, "User cancelled Permissions flow.")
      else -> Log.e(TAG, "Failed to grant permissions: ${result.errorMessage}")
    }
  }
}
```
## Grant Permissions Flow
The `requestPermissions()` call triggers a dialog flow:
1.  User selects a Google Account.
2.  User selects a structure to grant access to.
The available devices depend on the app's registration status in the Google Home Developer Console.
*   **Unverified App (Not registered in Developer Console):**
    *   Recommended for testing.
    *   Only registered test users (limit 100) can grant permissions.
    *   Access is granted to all devices of any type supported by the Home APIs within the selected structure.
*   **Verified App (Registered in Developer Console):**
    *   Required for production.
    *   Requires brand verification for OAuth.
    *   Any user can grant permission.
    *   Permission is limited to the device types approved in the Developer Console.
    *   For sensitive device types (e.g., locks), the user can restrict access on a per-device basis.
If a user denies permission for a device, the app cannot access, control, or automate it.
## Change Permissions
To let a user grant access to a different structure, call `requestPermissions()` again with `forceLaunch=true`. This re-launches the account and structure picker, and the consent screen.
```kotlin
homeManager.requestPermissions(forceLaunch=true)
```
## Revoke Permissions
Users can revoke access in two ways:
1.  **Google MyAccounts Page:** Go to **Data & privacy > Third-party apps & services**. This revokes the OAuth token for all instances of the app.
    *   Deep Link: `https://myaccount.google.com/connections/link?project_number=<Cloud project_number>`
2.  **Google Home App (GHA):** Go to **Settings > Linked Apps**. Users can remove app access entirely or change permissions for specific device types or sensitive devices.
## OkGoogle Permissions
The `okGoogle` command is a device-level command for automations. Permission enforcement depends on the scope of the command.
| Automation | Trait | Permissions Enforcement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Broadcast "Bedtime" on bedroom speaker. | `AssistantBroadcastTrait` on device. | **Creation & Execution:** App and user must have access to the specific broadcast device (must be an Assistant device). |
| Broadcast "Bedtime" on all devices. | `AssistantBroadcastTrait` on structure. | **Creation & Execution:** App and user must have access to the structure and at least one Assistant device within it. |
| "play some music" | `AssistantFulfillmentTrait.OkGoogleCommand` | **Creation & Execution:** App and user must have access to the devices the automation commands. |
| When someone says "play some music" | `VoiceStarterTrait.OkGoogleEvent` | **Creation:** App and user need structure access. **Execution:** App doesn't need permission for the starting device, but needs permission for the device where the action occurs. |
**Note:** If a user revokes full permissions, all existing automations will stop working without notice. If access to specific devices is revoked, starters, conditions, and actions for those devices will also stop working.

# Home APIs for Android Overview
The Google Home APIs for Android offer a unified API surface for developers to interact with entities in a user's home, including devices and non-device information. These concepts are similar to those in the [Google Home Graph](/cloud-to-cloud/primer/home-graph).
## Key Entities
*   **Structures**: A home containing rooms and devices.
*   **Rooms**: Part of a structure, containing devices.
*   **Devices**: Implement traits, conform to types, emit events, and respond to commands. Devices may be backed by [Matter](/matter), be a Cloud-to-cloud device, or a combination. See [Supported device types](/apis/android/supported-device-types).
*   **Automations**: Part of a structure, using home metadata and devices to automate tasks.
### Device Traits
Device functionality is grouped by traits. For more details, see [Data model on Android](/apis/android/data-model).
*   **Matter**: Functionality is grouped by **clusters**, represented as **Matter standard traits**.
*   **Google Home Ecosystem**: Functionality is grouped by **smart home traits**, as defined in the [Cloud-to-cloud program](/cloud-to-cloud/traits).
*   Other available traits include **Manufacturer-specific clusters** and **Platform traits**.
## Ecosystem Components
*   **Google Automation Engine**: Stores and runs [automations](/apis/android/automation).
*   **OAuth 2.0**: Grants apps permission to access devices without exposing user credentials.
*   **Google Home Developer Console**: Manages all project stages, from development and testing to certification and launch.
    *   **Important:** The console is not yet available for registration.
## Language: Kotlin & Flow
The APIs are written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/android-overview.html) and use [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) for state management and subscription.

## Entity Identifiers
Each entity has a unique and stable ID (see [`HasId`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasId)) that persists for its lifetime, suitable for caching or equality checks even if metadata changes.
## Terminology Mapping
| Home APIs | Matter | Cloud-to-cloud |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trait | Cluster | Trait |
| Attribute | Attribute | Attribute, State |
| Command | Command | Command |
| Event | Event | Follow up response, Notification |

# Data model on Android
The Home APIs for Android present all devices in the Google Home ecosystem (from Google Nest or 3rd party manufacturers) in a unified data model. This model supports technologies like Matter and Cloud-to-cloud, providing a common API surface for developers.
## Device types
- Device types unify Matter and Cloud-to-cloud data models. They can be derived directly from Matter, be extensions of Matter types, or come from Cloud-to-cloud.
- They contain **traits** for controlling and managing devices.
- The model is **Matter-first**, meaning Matter device types and traits take precedence over their Cloud-to-cloud analogs.
- See the list of [Supported device types on Android](/apis/android/supported-device-types).
## Traits
- Traits are provided as Kotlin versions with Home API-specific features, such as methods to check if a device supports a specific attribute or command.
- Each trait is in its own namespace and must be imported individually.
**Example Imports:**
- For a Matter `OnOffPluginUnitDevice`:
  ```kotlin
  import com.google.home.matter.standard.OnOff
  import com.google.home.matter.standard.OnOffPluginUnitDevice
  ```
- For a Google smart home `GarageDevice`:
  ```kotlin
  import com.google.home.google.LockUnlock
  import com.google.home.matter.standard.DoorLock
  import com.google.home.matter.standard.GoogleGarageDevice
  ```
- **Note:** Package names are not always consistent across all types and traits; verify them in the reference documentation.
- **Tip:** Device types starting with `Google*` are from the Google smart home ecosystem, not Google-branded hardware.
- Traits are also supported for Automations, though some may be limited or exclusive to that use case. See [Automation API trait support on Android](/apis/android/automation/supported-traits).
## Device type composition
- The Home APIs expose most Matter application clusters as traits, excluding those not relevant to end-users (e.g., `Binding`, `Groups`).
- Device types are composed of traits from both Matter and Cloud-to-cloud sources.
- Cloud-to-cloud traits may retain their names (e.g., `OpenClose`) or be represented as extensions of Matter traits to bridge functionality gaps. `Google*` device types are examples of Cloud-to-cloud types that don't yet have a Matter equivalent.
- This composition creates a flexible model that abstracts the underlying smart home technologies.
**Example: `FanDevice`**
The `FanDevice` type is composed of traits from both sources:
- `Identify`: From Matter.
- `FanControl`: From Matter.
- `ExtendedFanControl`: A Google trait that adds functionality from the Google smart home `FanSpeed` trait not covered by the Matter `FanControl` trait.

# Connectivity on Android
Home API capabilities on Android vary depending on network connectivity and hub status.
*   **Local**: A controller (e.g., Google Home app) is on the same Wi-Fi network as the device.
*   **Remote**: A controller is on a separate Wi-Fi network or the user is on Google Home for web.

# Interoperability on Android
Devices in the Google Home ecosystem can be implemented using **Cloud-to-cloud**, **Matter**, or both. Complex device types, which can be composed of different combinations of traits, present a development challenge for ensuring smooth interoperability. The mapping between Cloud-to-cloud and Matter data models is not always a clear one-to-one relationship.
This document provides guidance on data model mappings and recommended implementations for specific device types.
## Oven
The `OvenDevice` type is not straightforward to implement. There are multiple ways to implement an Oven in Matter, but not all approaches guarantee seamless interoperation with the Google Home ecosystem.
### Trait Mapping
> **Caution:** The following information is subject to change. Implementations based on this guidance may cease to operate as required in the future.
Instead of using the `Oven Mode` and `On Off` clusters, we recommend using the **`Oven Cavity Operational State` cluster**. This cluster is represented in the Home APIs by the `OvenCavityOperationalState` trait and maps to the Cloud-to-cloud `RunCycle` trait. It defines phases like "pre-heating", "pre-heated", and "cooling down".
| Home APIs | Cloud-to-cloud |
| :--- | :--- |
| `OvenCavityOperationalState` | `RunCycle` |
**Limitations:** The Cloud-to-cloud Oven data model only allows for a single chamber and a single `RunCycle`. In contrast, Matter can model a multi-chamber Oven as a device endpoint with an `Oven Cavity Operational State` cluster for each chamber.
For some Ovens, the phase list may need to change at runtime (e.g., different entries during preheating vs. heating phases).
### Recommended Implementation
*   A Matter Oven implementation should use the `Oven Cavity Operational State` cluster, which is modeled in the Home APIs as the `OvenCavityOperationalState` trait.
*   For best results, ensure your Cloud-to-cloud Oven device implements the `RunCycle` trait and publishes the current state by setting the `currentRunCycle` attribute. This is observable by the Home APIs through `OvenCavityOperationalState.phaseList` and `OvenCavityOperationalState.currentPhase`.
*   The Oven should also publish a run cycle device notification by updating the `priority`, `status`, and `currentCycleRemainingTime` attributes of `RunCycle`. The following example results in an `OperationalState.OperationCompletion` event, indicating the oven has transitioned from 'pre-heating' to 'pre-heated':
```json
{
  "currentRunCycle": [
    {
      "currentCycle": "pre-heating",
      "nextCycle": "pre-heated",
      "lang": "en"
    }
  ],
  "currentTotalRemainingTime": 1200,
  "currentCycleRemainingTime": 300
}
```
> **Important:** The event publication should occur simultaneously with the actual device state change, or **immediately after**. Do not send the event before the state change.
### Use an Oven in an Automation
When building an automation for an Oven, reference the `currentPhase` attribute to know which cycle the oven is in:
```kotlin
sequential {
  val starterNode =
    starter<_>(oven, OvenDevice, OvenCavityOperationalState /* Or OperationalState */)
  condition {
    expression = starterNode.phaseList[operationalState.currentPhase.toUInt()] equals "pre-heated"
  }
  action(speaker, SpeakerDevice) {
    command(AssistantBroadcast.broadcast("Oven Cycle Complete"))
  }
  // Additional actions here as needed
}
```
For a complete example, see [Blink the lights and announce when the oven reaches the chosen temperature](/apis/android/automation/examples#blink-lights).

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/error-handling

# Error Handling on Android
Kotlin's lack of [checked exceptions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/exceptions.html#checked-exceptions) simplifies error handling. You only need to handle potentially recoverable exceptions, which keeps your code less cluttered and more focused on its primary purpose.
## Handling `HomeException`
All methods in the Home APIs can throw a `HomeException`. It is recommended to wrap all API calls in a `try-catch` block to handle these recoverable failures. Any unhandled exceptions will cause your app to crash.
When catching a `HomeException`, inspect its `code` and `message` fields to understand the error. For example, if an invalid ID causes a `HomeException`, you could remove that ID from your cache or show the user a "Structure not found" message.
```kotlin
val result =
   try {
     homeManager.requestPermissions()
   } catch (e: HomeException) {
     PermissionsResult(
       PermissionsResultStatus.ERROR,
       "Got HomeException with error: ${e.message}",
     )
   }
```
### `HomeException` Codes
The following table explains the meaning of each `HomeException` code.
| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ABORTED` | The operation was aborted due to a concurrency issue (e.g., a sequencer check failure). |
| `ALREADY_EXISTS` | The entity a client attempted to create already exists. |
| `API_NOT_CONNECTED` | The API call failed to connect, possibly because the device is offline or doesn't support the API. |
| `CANCELLED` | The operation was cancelled, typically by the caller. |
| `DATA_LOSS` | Unrecoverable data loss or corruption has occurred. |
| `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` | The deadline expired before the operation could complete. For state-changing operations, this error may be returned even if the operation succeeded. |
| `FAILED_PRECONDITION` | The system is not in a state required for the operation's execution (e.g., calling `stop` on an already stopped oven). |
| `INTERNAL` | Internal errors, indicating that some system invariants have been broken. This code is reserved for serious errors. |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | The client provided an argument outside the expected range of values. |
| `NOT_FOUND` | A requested entity was not found. May also be used if a request is denied for an entire class of users (e.g., a feature rollout). For user-based access control, `PERMISSION_DENIED` must be used. |
| `OUT_OF_RANGE` | The operation was attempted past the valid range (e.g., seeking past end-of-file). Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this may be fixable if the system state changes. |
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | The caller does not have permission for the operation. Do not use for resource exhaustion (`RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`) or if the caller is unidentified (`UNAUTHENTICATED`). |
| `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | A resource has been exhausted (e.g., a per-user quota is reached or a pet feeder is out of food). |
| `SDK_INITIALIZATION_MISSING_INFO` | The SDK was initialized without required information (e.g., a trait was not included). See [Initialize the home on Android](/apis/initialization). |
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` | The request lacks valid authentication credentials or the caller cannot be identified. |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | The service is unavailable, likely a transient condition. Retrying with a backoff may help, but retrying non-idempotent operations is not always safe. |
| `UNIMPLEMENTED` | The requested operation is not implemented, supported, or enabled in this service. |
| `UNKNOWN` | An unknown error occurred, often when an external API returns a status with insufficient detail. |
**Note:** In logs, error codes may appear as numeric values (e.g., `13` instead of `INTERNAL`). For the full list of numeric mappings, see the [`HomeException.Codes` reference](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HomeException.Codes).

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/commissioning

# Commissioning API on Android
**Note:** If the Commissioning API on Android is not used, users can still commission Matter devices using the Google Home app (GHA). See [Set up and manage Matter-enabled devices](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/13127223).
The Commissioning API allows an app to commission a device to either:
*   Your fabric and the Google fabric.
*   Only the Google fabric.
## Ways to commission Matter devices
The commissioning process can be initiated:
*   [Directly in your app](#request-commissioning-directly-in-your-app)
*   [Through Fast Pair or QR-code scanning on Android](#matter-commissioning-entry-point-for-fast-pair-or-qr-code-scanning-android-only)
### Request commissioning directly in your app
This can be triggered by an in-app action for single or multiple fabrics.
#### For single fabrics
1.  Initialize an `ActivityResultLauncher` in your activity to handle the commissioning result. If the device is commissioned on the Google fabric, the result may include the user-assigned device name.
    ```kotlin
    private val commissioningLauncher =
      registerForActivityResult(StartIntentSenderForResult()) { result ->
        val resultCode = result.resultCode
        if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
            Log.i("CommissioningActivity", "Commissioning success")
      val deviceName =
              CommissioningResult.fromIntentSenderResult(result.resultCode, result.data).deviceName
          } else {
              Log.i("CommissioningActivity", "Commissioning failed")
          }
        }
    ```
2.  Construct a `CommissioningRequest`, including the payload data, and set the option to commission to the Google fabric using `setStoreToGoogleFabric`.
    *   **Warning:** If you don't set the payload, the QR code scanner will reappear, creating a poor user experience.
    *   To commission to your own fabric as well, use `setCommissioningService()` in the `CommissioningRequest`.
    ```kotlin
    val commissioningRequest = CommissioningRequest.builder()
            .setOnboardingPayload(payload)
            .setStoreToGoogleFabric(true)
      // set all other options that you care about
            .build()
    ```
3.  Use the `CommissioningClient` instance to start commissioning.
    ```kotlin
    commissioningClient
      .commissionDevice(commissioningRequest)
      .addOnSuccessListener { result ->
        Log.i("CommissioningActivity", "Commissioning success")
    _commissioningIntentSender.postValue(result)
          }
          .addOnFailureListener { error ->
            Log.i("CommissioningActivity", "Commissioning failed")
      }
    ```
4.  Once the `CommissioningClient` returns the `IntentSender`, launch it.
    ```kotlin
    commissioningIntentSender.observe(this) { sender ->
      if (sender != null) {
        commissioningLauncher.launch(IntentSenderRequest.Builder(sender).build())
      }
    }
    ```
#### For multiple fabrics (multi-admin)
Refer to [Multi-admin for Commissioning API on Android](/apis/android/commissioning/multi-admin).
### Matter commissioning entry point for Fast Pair or QR-code scanning (Android only)
This can be done for single or multiple fabrics.
#### For single fabrics
Use the `ACTION_START_COMMISSIONING` intent filter to provide full commissioning capability without needing the GHA. This allows the user to assign a name to the device when commissioning to the Google fabric.
*   **Note:** If you are not operating your own Matter fabric and user permissions have not been granted, the device won't be accessible in the app. You must [request permission from the user](/apis/initialization#request_permissions) after commissioning.
To indicate support for Google fabric commissioning, add the following `intent-filter` to **one** activity declaration in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<intent-filter>
  <action android:name="com.google.android.gms.home.matter.ACTION_START_COMMISSIONING" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
 </intent-filter>
```
*   **Important:** Adding the filter to more than one activity results in undefined behavior. This filter includes your app in the list of suggested Matter apps.
#### For multiple fabrics (multi-admin)
The Fast Pair flow can also be used in multi-admin scenarios. For more information, refer to [Multi-admin for Commissioning API on Android](/apis/android/commissioning/multi-admin).
## Handle the incoming intent
Once your activity is launched, check for the `ACTION_START_COMMISSIONING` intent and retrieve the payload:
```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    val payload = if (Matter.ACTION_START_COMMISSIONING.equals(intent.getAction())) {
      intent.getStringExtra(Matter.EXTRA_ONBOARDING_PAYLOAD)
    } else {
      null
    }
    CommissioningRequest.builder()
          .setOnboardingPayload(payload)
          .setStoreToGoogleFabric(true)
    // set all other options that you care about
    startCommissioning(commissioningRequest)
}
```
A non-`null` payload indicates the user has already scanned the device QR code or entered the pairing key. A `null` payload does **not** mean that commissioning should be aborted.
## Suppress commissionable discovery notifications
By default, Google Play services on Android uses "halfsheet" notifications to indicate nearby commissionable Matter devices.
To prevent these interruptions while your app is in the foreground, call the `suppressHalfSheetNotification()` method. This suppression times out if your app is in the foreground for more than 15 minutes. To re-enable suppression after a timeout, call `suppressHalfSheetNotification()` again.
## How to share Matter devices on your fabric with Google
Google strongly recommends using the Commissioning API as the primary means of sharing a device that you have already set up on your fabric with the Google fabric.
### Why use the Commissioning API instead of the Share API?
The Commissioning API offers a direct and preferred method. The Share API requires more user steps, such as having GHA installed and manually selecting it. To use the Commissioning API for sharing, open the commissioning window and call the API as a [secondary Matter commissioner](/apis/android/commissioning/multi-admin#secondary).
### When to use the Share API?
Use the [Share API](/reference/kotlin/com/google/android/gms/home/matter/commissioning/ShareDeviceRequest) to let the end-user pick an eligible application to share a device generically with other Matter ecosystems.

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/commissioning/multi-admin

# Multi-admin for Commissioning API on Android
The Commissioning API on Android supports multi-administration for Matter, allowing it to serve as either a primary or secondary commissioner.
### Commissioner Roles
*   **Primary Matter Commissioner**:
    *   The Google fabric is added first via the Google UX.
    *   A custom commissioner can then be called to add another fabric after the Matter commissioning window is re-opened.
    *   If Google's commissioning fails, the custom commissioning service will not run.
*   **Secondary Matter Commissioner**:
    *   Your app can implement its own commissioning UX to onboard a device to its own fabric first.
    *   The Google Commissioning API can be called later to add the Google fabric.
    *   **Google Recommendation**: When a user has granted Home API permissions, your app should actively prompt them to add Google's fabric after your commissioning flow is complete.
### How to Use as Primary Commissioner (Google-preferred flow)
1.  The user starts the flow in your app (e.g., taps **Add Device**).
2.  The Google UX takes control for scanning the Matter QR code.
3.  The user agrees to connect the device to their Google account.
4.  The user selects a home. The process ends if no home, hubs, or permissions are available.
5.  On the **Device connected** screen, the user names the device and chooses a room.
6.  The **Getting your device ready** screen appears as the device is onboarded to the Matter fabric.
7.  Your app resumes control, and a registered custom commissioner can run to add additional fabrics.
### How to Use as Secondary Commissioner
1.  The user starts the flow in your app.
2.  Your app's commissioning UX runs to add the device to your fabric.
3.  After completion, your app can trigger the Google process (e.g., if the user has opted into Google Home APIs).
4.  Your app calls the Commissioning API with the device payload (passcode, discriminator, etc.).
5.  The Google commissioning process adds the device to the Google fabric.

# End-user Onboarding Flows on Android for Google Home APIs
This guide provides UX guidance for designing seamless device permission and sharing flows in your application.
**Topics:**
*   Why share devices with Google Home?
*   Key components of the sharing flow
*   Technical implementation
*   UX best practices
## Why Share Devices with Google Home?
Sharing devices is necessary for Home API capabilities because:
*   It's a technical requirement for Google to use devices in automations.
*   It maintains a consistent user experience, preventing fragmentation where users must switch between apps for basic tasks.
## Key Components of the Sharing Flow
*   **Permissions API on Android**: Prompts users to grant your app permission to access devices in their home (the "structure"). This is required before using any Home APIs.
*   **Cloud-to-cloud Linking**: Starts the account-linking process to share cloud-connected devices with Google Home from within your app. Deep linking is recommended to reduce friction.
*   **Commissioning API on Android**: Used to commission new Matter devices or add the Google fabric to Matter devices already commissioned to another fabric.
## Technical Implementation
The recommended implementation order depends on the types of devices you produce.
**General Guidance:**
*   **Cloud-to-cloud first:** Perform Cloud-to-cloud deep linking before requesting permissions to avoid confusing users with mixed lists of shared and unshared devices.
*   **Matter Device Sharing:** Since sharing must be done per device and requires user input, guide the user by:
    *   Showing a list of Matter devices not shared with Google.
    *   Allowing users to start sharing from that list (using the Commissioning API).
    *   Returning to the list to show progress and status.
### Scenarios
*   **You only produce Matter devices:**
    1.  Call the Permissions API on Android.
    2.  Call the Commissioning API on Android for each applicable Matter device (follow general guidance above).
*   **You only produce Cloud-to-cloud devices:**
    1.  Perform Cloud-to-cloud deep linking.
    2.  Call the Permissions API on Android.
*   **You produce both Cloud-to-cloud and Matter devices:**
    1.  Perform Cloud-to-cloud deep linking.
    2.  Call the Permissions API on Android.
    3.  Call the Commissioning API for Android for each applicable Matter device (follow general guidance above).
*   **You have no devices to share with Google:**
    *   Call the Permissions API.
## UX Best Practices
### Entry Points for Device Sharing
Consider these non-mutually exclusive entry points:
*   **Settings Menu**: A familiar location for users to manage connections. You can separate device sharing (Cloud-to-cloud, Matter) from app permissioning (Permissions API) to give users more control and show connection status.
*   **Automations Tab**: When a user interacts with a Google-run automation, present an entry point to the sharing flow with a clear value proposition.
*   **Commissioning Flow**: For partners with only Matter devices (no cloud or own fabric), integrate sharing (Commissioning API) and permissioning (Permissions API) into a single flow right after the out-of-box experience.
### Sharing Logic
*   Prompt users to complete only the missing steps. (e.g., if devices are already shared via cloud, only request Home API permissions).
*   Cloud-to-cloud linking shouldn't be a prerequisite for Home API permissions, as different home administrators might manage different aspects.
### Visual Design Suggestions
*   Clearly state the benefit of onboarding (e.g., "Create advanced automations powered by Google Home").
*   Include a clear call-to-action (e.g., "Get Started") and a way to cancel.
*   Briefly explain what will happen during the flow.
*   For Matter, if permissions are already granted, prompt the user to share a new device with the Google fabric right after adding it to your fabric.
### Content Suggestions
*   **Focus on the "what's in it for me?"** for the user.
*   **Be enticing but don't over-promise.** Clearly state device requirements.
*   **Keep text concise** (under 4 lines per block), but prioritize clarity.
*   **Use exciting examples** for automations.
*   **Use a playful tone** if it aligns with your brand.
*   **Use actionable phrases** like "Get started."

# Commissioning UX on Android
The commissioning flow using the Commissioning API can be initiated in two ways: directly within your app or through the Fast Pair app picker.
## Initiated by the App
This flow begins when a user starts commissioning from within your app, typically via an **"Add Device"** call-to-action (CTA).
**CTA Placement Recommendations:**
*   On a **Controls** page where users see their devices.
*   On a **Settings** page for home management.
*   On the app's **Home** page.
After commissioning, it's recommended to direct the user to the app's Home page or a view showing the newly added device.
### UX Flow
1.  The user taps **Add device**.
2.  The user scans the QR code or enters the pairing code.
3.  The user is prompted to add the device to the Google fabric and select a Google Account.
4.  If the user has multiple Homes, they are prompted to select one. If no Home exists, one named "Home" is created automatically.
5.  The Commissioning API connects to the device.
6.  The user selects a room for the device.
7.  The user renames the device.
8.  The Commissioning API generates Matter credentials, checks network connectivity, and commissions the device to the chosen fabric.
9.  If permissions for the user's structure and devices have been granted, the device will appear in the app and be controllable. Otherwise, [permission is required](/apis/initialization) for access and control.
## Initiated by Fast Pair
Commissioning can also start via Fast Pair after a user scans a device's Matter QR code. The user is then prompted to select an app to continue the process.
If the user does not have your app installed, they will be prompted to install it before proceeding. The subsequent UX is the same as the app-initiated flow from the consent screen onwards.
### UX Flow
1.  The user scans the device's Matter QR code.
2.  The user is prompted to select an app to continue.
3.  If the app isn't installed, the user is prompted to install it from the Google Play Store.
4.  Once the app is ready, the user agrees to add the device to the Google fabric and selects a Google Account.
5.  The user selects a Home. A default "Home" is created if none exist.
6.  The Commissioning API connects to the device.
7.  The user selects the device's room.
8.  The user renames the device.
9.  The Commissioning API generates credentials, checks the network, and completes the commissioning process.
10. If permissions have been granted, the device appears in the app and is controllable. Otherwise, [permission is required](/apis/initialization).
## App Picker
Your app can appear in two places during the commissioning process:
1.  On the **Choose an app** screen.
2.  On the **Other Installed Apps** screen, if the user selects **Choose other app**.
### Suggested Apps
The **Choose an app** screen displays two suggestions:
*   The first is always the Google Home app (GHA).
*   The second is the device maker's preferred app, if one is defined in the Google Home Developer Console project associated with the device's VID or PID.
### App Status on the "Choose an app" screen
*   **Installed**: Google Play services verifies that the app supports the `ACTION_COMMISSION_DEVICE` intent filter. If the filter is missing, the user is directed to the Play Store to update the app.
*   **Not Installed**: The user is directed to the Play Store to install the app before continuing.

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/structure

# Structure APIs on Android
> **Note:** An application can only be granted permission to one structure at a time.
Structure APIs are accessed through the Home APIs for Android.
## Setup
Import the necessary packages:
```kotlin
import com.google.home.Home
import com.google.home.Id
import com.google.home.Structure
```
## Error Handling
All Home API methods can throw a `HomeException`. Use a `try-catch` block for all calls and check the exception's `code` and `message` fields to handle errors. Unhandled exceptions will crash your app.
For more information, see [Error handling](/apis/android/error-handling).
## API Usage
> **Important:** The Structure API only returns structures the developer has been granted access to.
### Get Structures
The `home.structures()` call returns a `Flow` of structures.
**Reactive Approach:**
```kotlin
// Get a flow of all structures accessible to the user.
val allStructuresFlow: HomeObjectsFlow<Structure> = home.structures()
// Calling list() on a HomeObjectsFlow returns the first Set of elements.
val allStructures: Set<Structure> = allStructuresFlow.list()
```
*   The flow may not immediately return a valid list. Your app should handle cases where an empty list is returned (e.g., no connectivity, revoked permissions).
**Imperative Approach:**
Use a terminal flow operator to wait for a valid list with a timeout.
```kotlin
val everyStructure = withTimeout(5000) { home.structures().first { it.isNotEmpty() } }
```
### Get Structure Properties
Get a flow for a single structure or a snapshot of its properties.
```kotlin
// Get a flow on a structure. Flow emits new values on metadata changes.
val structureFlow: Flow<Structure> = home.structures().itemFlow(myStructureId)
// Get a snapshot of the structure.
val structure: Structure = structureFlow.first()
// Get structure properties.
println("id ${structure.id}")
println("name ${structure.name}")
```
### Find a Structure by Name
```kotlin
val myHome = home.structures().list().first { it.name == "My home" }
```
### Work with Multiple Structures
Get a separate reference for each structure, handling exceptions individually.
```kotlin
var structure1: Structure? = null
var structure2: Structure? = null
try {
  structure1 = home.structures().list().firstOrNull { it.name == "Main House" }
} catch (e: HomeException) {
  // Code for handling the exception
}
try {
  structure2 = home.structures().list().firstOrNull { it.name == "Guest Cottage" }
} catch (e: HomeException) {
  // Code for handling the exception
}
```
### Manage Rooms
#### Get a list of rooms
```kotlin
val allRoomsFlow: HomeObjectsFlow<Room> = structure.rooms()
val allRooms: Set<Room> = allRoomsFlow.list()
val room: Room = allRooms.first()
println("id ${room.id}")
println("name ${room.name}")
```
#### Create a room
```kotlin
val newRoom: Room = structure.createRoom("Test Room Name")
```
#### Delete a room
You can delete a room by its object or ID.
```kotlin
// By object
val roomToDelete = structure.rooms().list().filter { it.name == "room_id1" }.firstOrNull()
structure.deleteRoom(roomToDelete!!)
// By ID
val roomToDelete1 = allRooms.filter { it.id == testRoomId }.firstOrNull()
structure.deleteRoom(roomToDelete1!!)
```
*   If a room containing devices is deleted, the devices remain in the structure but are no longer assigned to a room.
#### Move devices to a different room
You can move devices using their objects or IDs.
```kotlin
// By object
val room2 = structure.rooms().get(Id("room_id_other_structure"))
val device1 = structure.devices().get(Id("device_id1"))
structure.moveDevicesToRoom(room2!!, listOf(device1!!))
// By ID
structure.moveDevicesToRoom(Id("room_id_other_structure"), listOf(Id("device_id1")))
```
#### Change the name of a room
```kotlin
livingRoom.setName("Living Room")
```
*   Names are truncated if they exceed 60 Unicode code points.

# Supported device types on Android
Device support is determined by traits from the Google Home ecosystem or the Matter specification, which enable specific features. For more details, see [Data model on Android](/apis/android/data-model).
> **Note:** Provisional Matter device types and clusters are not supported.
### Table Key
*   `matter`: Indicates the trait is from the Matter standard.
*   `google`: Indicates the trait is from the Google smart home ecosystem.
*   **Kotlin Sample App**: Indicates if device state or limited control is implemented in the [sample app](/apis/android/sample-app/build).
*   **Use Case**: The corresponding device type from the Google Home ecosystem, as featured on the [Use Cases](/use-cases) page.
*   **Device type IDs**: Unique identifiers (e.g., `home.matter.0000.types.002d`) which correspond to the Matter Vendor ID (VID).
> **Tip:** Device types that begin with `Google*` are Google smart home device types, not Google-branded devices.
The following devices and their associated traits are supported by the Home APIs for Android:
| Home APIs Device Type | Traits | Kotlin Sample App | Use Case |

# Android Device & Metadata APIs
Access devices and their metadata using the Home APIs for Android.
### Required Imports
Import the base packages:
```kotlin
import com.google.home.Home
import com.google.home.HomeDevice
import com.google.home.Id
```
Import specific device types or traits as needed. For example, for the Matter On/Off trait and On/Off Plug-in Unit device type:
```kotlin
import com.google.home.matter.standard.OnOff
import com.google.home.matter.standard.OnOffPluginUnitDevice
```
**Note:** Android Studio's auto-complete feature lists available packages. For more information, see [Data model on Android](/apis/android/data-model).
## Error Handling
All Home API methods can throw a `HomeException`. Use a `try-catch` block for all calls and check the `code` and `message` fields to identify the error. Unhandled exceptions will crash your app.
See [Error handling](/apis/android/error-handling) and [Send a command to a device](/apis/android/device/control#send-command) for examples.
## Sample Calls
### Get a list of devices
Get a `Flow` of all devices accessible from a structure:
```kotlin
// Get a flow of all devices accessible to the user
val allDevicesFlow: HomeObjectsFlow<HomeDevice> = home.devices()
// Calling list() on a HomeObjectsFlow returns the first Set of elements.
val allDevices: Set<HomeDevice> = allDevicesFlow.list()
```
### Read a device state
Retrieve a specific trait's data, like the `OnOff` attribute, through the device type's `standardTraits` class. Use `distinctUntilChanged` to only trigger on specific trait changes.
```kotlin
// Assuming we have a device.
val deviceFlow = home.devices().itemFlow(myDeviceId)
val device = deviceFlow.first()
// Get a flow of a standard trait on the type.
val onOffTraitFlow: Flow<OnOff?> =
  device.type(DimmableLightDevice).map { it.standardTraits.onOff }.distinctUntilChanged()
val onOffTrait: OnOff = onOffTraitFlow.first()!!
```
See [`distinctUntilChanged`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/distinct-until-changed.html) for more details.
### Invalidate state in a trait subscription
The [`TraitStateInvalidation` interface](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/TraitStateInvalidation) forces a read of the current trait state, returning the result through existing trait flows. This is useful when state is not reported correctly (e.g., Matter traits with "C" quality).
```kotlin
val onOffTrait = device.?type(DimmableLightDevice)?.map{it.trait(OnOff)}.first()
onOffTrait.forceRead()
```
**Important:** Use this API sparingly as it can impact device performance and battery life.
### Get a list of device type traits
Device types decompose a device into its functional pieces and handle trait collisions. To get the list of available traits for a device type:
```kotlin
// Get all types available on this device.
val typesFlow: Flow<Set<DeviceType>> = device.types()
val types: Set<DeviceType> = typesFlow.first()
// Get the DimmableLightDevice instance from the set of types.
val dimmableLightDevice = types.filterIsInstance<DimmableLightDevice>().firstOrNull()
// Get all traits in the type + traits registered
val allTraits: Set<Trait> = dimmableLightDevice!!.traits()
```
To avoid ambiguity when a device has traits with the same name (e.g., standard vs. manufacturer-defined), use qualifying namespaces:
*   `standardTraits`: For standard traits (analogous to Matter standard clusters).
*   `googleTraits`: For Google traits.
```kotlin
// Accessing standard traits on the type.
val onOffTrait: OnOff? = dimmableLightDevice.standardTraits.onOff
val levelControlTrait: LevelControl? = dimmableLightDevice.standardTraits.levelControl
// Accessing a custom trait on the type.
val customTrait = dimmableLightDevice.trait(MyCustomTrait)
```
### Get a list of devices with a specific trait
Use Kotlin's [`filter`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/collection-filtering.html) to find devices with a specific trait.
```kotlin
// Get all devices that support OnOff
val onOffDevices: Flow<List<HomeDevice>> =
  home.devices().map { devices -> devices.filter { it.has(OnOff) } }
```
See the [`Trait` interface](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/Trait) for a full list of traits.
### Get a list of devices with similar device types
To get a comprehensive view of a higher-level device type (e.g., all "lights"), filter for multiple related device types.
```kotlin
// Get a list of devices with similar device types (lights)
val lightDevices =
  home.devices().map { devices ->
    devices.filter {
      it.has(DimmableLightDevice) ||
        it.has(OnOffLightDevice) ||
        it.has(ColorTemperatureLightDevice) ||
        it.has(ExtendedColorLightDevice)
    }
  }
```
See the [`DeviceType` interface](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/DeviceType) for a full list of device types.
### Get the Vendor ID or Product ID for a device
The [`BasicInformation`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/matter/standard/BasicInformation) trait includes Vendor ID, Product ID, Product Name, and Serial Number.
```kotlin
// Get device basic information. All general information traits are on the RootNodeDevice type.
val basicInformation = device.type(RootNodeDevice).first().standardTraits.basicInformation!!
println("vendorName ${basicInformation.vendorName}")
println("vendorId ${basicInformation.vendorId}")
println("productId ${basicInformation.productId}")
```
#### Cloud-to-cloud device identification for device manufacturers
To identify your [Cloud-to-cloud](/cloud-to-cloud/get-started) devices via the `BasicInformation` trait, include these string fields in their `SYNC` response:
*   `"matterOriginalVendorId"`: The CSA-issued vendor ID (e.g., `"0xfff1"`).
*   `"matterOriginalProductId"`: A unique product identifier (e.g., `"0x1234"`).
*   `"matterUniqueId"`: A manufacturer-specific unique device identifier (e.g., `"matter-device-id"`).
Example `SYNC` response:
```json
{
  "requestId": "ff36a3cc-ec34-11e6-b1a0-64510650abcf",
  "payload": {
    "agentUserId": "1836.15267389",
    "devices": [
      {
        "id": "456",
        "type": "action.devices.types.LIGHT",
        "traits": [
          "action.devices.traits.OnOff",
          "action.devices.traits.Brightness",
          "action.devices.traits.ColorSetting"
        ],
        "willReportState": true,
        "deviceInfo": { "...": "..." },
        "matterOriginalVendorId": "0xfff1",
        "matterOriginalProductId": "0x1234",
        "matterUniqueId": "matter-device-id",
        "otherDeviceIds": [
          {
            "deviceId": "local-device-id"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
See [Cloud-to-cloud `SYNC` documentation](/cloud-to-cloud/integration/sync#sync-request).
## Device and Trait Metadata
Each trait has a [`sourceConnectivity`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/SourceConnectivity) property with information about its online status and routing (local/remote).
### Get the primary type of a device
A device can have multiple types. Check for primary types to determine core functionality.
**Important:**
*   All types on the primary endpoint are primary types.
*   If one member of a Matter superset type (e.g., a light) is primary, all other present members of that superset are also primary.
```kotlin
val types = device.types().first()
val primaryTypes = types.filter { it.metadata.isPrimaryType }
```
### Check if a trait is online
Use the `connectivityState()` method. Cloud-based traits may be offline without internet connectivity.
```kotlin
val onOffConnectivity = onOffTrait?.metadata?.sourceConnectivity?.connectivityState
```
### Check connectivity for a device
Connectivity is checked at the device type level, aggregating all its trait states.
```kotlin
val lightConnectivity = dimmableLightDevice.metadata.sourceConnectivity.connectivityState
```
A state of `PARTIALLY_ONLINE` can occur with mixed local (Matter) and cloud-based traits.
**Important:** A device with `connectivityState` of [`PARTIALLY_ONLINE`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/ConnectivityState#PARTIALLY_ONLINE) should be represented to the user as "Online."
### Check the network routing of a trait
The `dataSourceLocality` indicates if routing is remote (cloud), local (hub), or peer-to-peer. An `UNSPECIFIED` value is possible during app boot when devices are unreachable.
```kotlin
val onOffLocality = onOffTrait?.metadata?.sourceConnectivity?.dataSourceLocality
```
### Check the network routing for a device
Like connectivity, locality is checked at the device type level, aggregating all trait localities. A `MIXED` state is possible.
```kotlin
val lightLocality = dimmableLightDevice.metadata.sourceConnectivity.dataSourceLocality
```
### Change the name of a device
Use the [`setName()`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HomeDevice#setName(kotlin.String)) method. Names are truncated if over the 60-character limit, and no errors are thrown.
```kotlin
mixerDevice.setName("Grendel")
```

# Control devices on Android
### Check if a trait supports a command
Use the trait-level `supports` function to check if a device supports a specific command.
```kotlin
// Check if the OnOff trait supports the toggle command.
if (onOffTrait.supports(OnOff.Command.Toggle)) {
  println("onOffTrait supports toggle command")
} else {
  println("onOffTrait does not support stateful toggle command")
}
```
**Note:** The `Command` enum value is capitalized (`Toggle`), while the method is not (`toggle`).
### Send a command to a device
To send a command, call the corresponding method on the trait. For example, to toggle a device's on/off state:
```kotlin
// Calling a command on a trait.
try {
  onOffTrait.toggle()
} catch (e: HomeException) {
  // Handle the exception
}
```
*   **All trait commands are `suspend` functions.** They complete only when a response is returned from the API.
*   **Commands can throw exceptions.** Always use a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors.
*   You can also use explicit commands like `onOffTrait.off()` or `onOffTrait.on()`.
*   After sending a command, the preferred method to get the updated state is to [observe state with flows](/apis/observe-state).
### Send a command with parameters
Some commands accept required or optional parameters.
**Required Parameters:**
```kotlin
// Turn off the light using the DyingLight effect.
onOffTrait.offWithEffect(
  effectIdentifier = OnOffTrait.EffectIdentifierEnum.DyingLight,
  effectVariant = 0u,
)
// Change the brightness of the light to 50%
levelControlTrait.moveToLevel(
  level = 127u.toUByte(), // Matter spec: currentLevel is 0-254. 127 is ~50%.
  transitionTime = null,
  optionsMask = LevelControlTrait.OptionsBitmap(),
  optionsOverride = LevelControlTrait.OptionsBitmap(),
)
```
**Optional Parameters:**
Optional arguments follow required ones. They can be set in a trailing lambda.
```kotlin
val fanControl = // ... get FanControl trait
// Calling with only required parameters
fanControl?.step(direction = FanControlTrait.StepDirectionEnum.Increase)
// Calling with an optional parameter
fanControl?.step(direction = FanControlTrait.StepDirectionEnum.Increase) { wrap = true }
```
### Check if a trait supports an attribute
Use the `supports` function with the trait's `Attribute` enum to verify attribute support, as some devices may not support every attribute of a trait.
```kotlin
// Check if the OnOff trait supports the onOff attribute.
if (onOffTrait.supports(OnOff.Attribute.onOff)) {
  println("onOffTrait supports onOff state")
} else {
  println("onOffTrait is for a command only device!")
}
```
For attributes that are nullable in the specification, you can use `isNullable` to distinguish between an unsupported attribute and one whose value is legitimately `null`.
```kotlin
if (onOffTrait.supports(OnOff.Attribute.startUpOnOff)) {
  // The device supports startUpOnOff.
  if (OnOff.Attribute.startUpOnOff.isNullable && onOffTrait.startUpOnOff == null) {
    // This value is nullable and currently set to null.
    println("onOffTrait supports startUpOnOff and it is null")
  } else {
    // This value is set.
    println("onOffTrait supports startUpOnOff and it is set to ${onOffTrait.startUpOnOff}")
  }
} else {
  println("onOffTrait does not support startUpOnOff!")
}
```
### Update trait attributes
An attribute's value can be changed if it is writable. How it can be changed depends on its properties:
*   **Read-only & not affected by commands**: The value is static (e.g., `SwitchTrait.currentPosition`).
*   **Read-only & affected by commands**: The value changes only as a side effect of a command (e.g., `LevelControlTrait.currentLevel` is changed by `moveToLevel`).
*   **Writable & not affected by commands**: The value can only be changed directly using the `update` function (e.g., `DoorLockTrait.WrongCodeEntryLimit`).
*   **Writable & affected by commands**: The value can be changed by both the `update` function and by commands (e.g., `FanControlTrait.speedSetting` is changed by `step`).
To directly set a writable attribute's value, use the trait's `update` function with a mutator.
```kotlin
val doorLockTrait: DoorLock = // ... get DoorLock trait
if (doorLockTrait.supports(DoorLock.Attribute.wrongCodeEntryLimit)) {
  doorLockTrait.update { setWrongCodeEntryLimit(3u) }
}
```
### Send multiple commands at once (Batching API)
**Warning:** This API is experimental and may change.
The Batching API allows sending multiple commands across different devices in a single payload for parallel execution.
**How to use the Batching API:**
1.  Invoke the `Home.sendBatchedCommands()` method.
2.  Inside its lambda block, specify commands to be included in the batch. Use the "shadow" versions of commands, which have a `Batchable` suffix (e.g., `onBatchable()`, `lockDoorBatchable()`).
3.  Add each command to the batch using `add()`. This returns a `DeferredResponse<T>`.
4.  The batch is sent automatically when execution leaves the lambda.
5.  **Important:** Individual command failures within the batch **do not** throw exceptions.
6.  Outside the `sendBatchedCommands()` block, check each `DeferredResponse<T>` by calling `getOrThrow()` to see if the command succeeded or failed.
**Example: 'Good Night' Scene**
This example turns off all lights and locks the front and back doors simultaneously.
```kotlin
val lightDevices: List<OnOffLightDevice> = // ...
val doorlockDevices: List<DoorLockDevice> = // ...
// 1. Send all commands in a batch
val responses: List<DeferredResponse<Unit>> = home.sendBatchedCommands {
  // 2. Add batchable commands for each light
  val lightResponses = lightDevices.map { lightDevice ->
    add(lightDevice.standardTraits.onOff.onBatchable())
  }
  // 3. Add batchable commands for each door lock
  val doorLockResponses = doorlockDevices.map { doorlockDevice ->
    add(doorlockDevice.standardTraits.doorLock.lockDoorBatchable())
  }
  lightResponses + doorLockResponses
}
// 4. Check all responses for success or failure outside the batch block
try {
  for (response in responses) {
    response.getOrThrow()
  }
  // All commands succeeded
} catch (e: Exception) {
  // At least one command failed
}
```

# Monitor Device State on Android
Observing state changes in the home (structures, rooms, devices) is done using Kotlin [flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow). Any API inheriting from [`HomeObjectsFlow`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HomeObjectsFlow) provides this capability.
When any item in a collection is added, deleted, or modified, the flow emits the latest snapshot of the entire collection. You must compare this snapshot with a previous version to deduce specific changes, using the `id` field provided for each [parent object type](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasId).
## Using Flows to Observe State
First, create an instance of `Home`:
```kotlin
val context = LocalContext.current
val homeManager = Home.getClient(context)
```
### Track Structure Changes
This flow is triggered by changes to a structure's [name](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/Structure#name()).
```kotlin
homeManager.structures().map { it.firstOrNull() }.collect {
  println("Structure ${it.id} updated to ${it}")
}
val structure =  homeManager.structures().list().firstOrNull()!!
```
### Track Specific Device Changes
Triggered by changes to a device's:
*   [Connectivity state](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/ConnectivityState)
*   [Name](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HomeDevice#name())
*   [Room](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HomeDevice#room()) membership
*   Supported [traits](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasTraits#has(com.google.home.TraitFactory))
*   Supported [types](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasDeviceTypes#has(com.google.home.DeviceTypeFactory))
```kotlin
structure
  .devices()
  .map { devices -> device.filter { it.name == "Bedroom Lamp" }.single() }
  .collect {
    println("The bedroom lamp has changed!")
  }
val device = structure.devices().list().firstOrNull { it.name == "Bedroom Lamp" }!!
```
### Track Specific Trait Changes on a Device
Use any trait supported by the device and the Home APIs. See [`Trait`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/Trait) for a full list.
```kotlin
val trait = device.type(DimmableLightDevice)?.map { it.trait(OnOff)}.first()
trait?.collect {
  if (it != null) {
    println("Got new state update! ${it.onOff}")
  }
}
```
### Track Specific Type Changes on a Device
Triggered by changes to any trait within the [generated device type](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasDeviceTypes#type(com.google.home.DeviceTypeFactory)). Use any Matter device type supported by the Home APIs. See [`DeviceType`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/DeviceType) for a full list.
```kotlin
device.type(DimmableLightDevice).collect { type ->
    println("Got new state update! ${type.trait(LevelControl)?.currentLevel}")
}
```
### Track Room Changes in a Structure
Triggered by changes to a room's:
*   [Name](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/Room#name())
*   [Structure](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/Room#structure()) membership
> **Note:** To track when devices are added or removed from a room, use the `devices()` flow.
```kotlin
structure.rooms().collect {
  println("Got a new updated set of rooms!")
  for (room in it) {
    println("Got room $room")
  }
}
```
## Subscribing to Device Events
Events are used to detect changes in a device's state.
> **Important:** Device manufacturers are not required to send Matter events. In such cases, you must rely on observing state changes as described in the section above. See [Observe state changes](/apis/observe-state).
To subscribe to events on a specific device, call one of the three [`HomeDevice`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HomeDevice).[`events`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasEvents#events(com.google.home.EventFactory)) functions, which return a `Flow<Event>`:
1.  **For a specific event type:**
    ```kotlin
    val eventFlow = homeDevice.type(DoorLockDevice).first().events(DoorLock.DoorLockAlarmEvent)
    ```
2.  **For all events from a trait:**
    ```kotlin
    val eventflow = homeDevice.type(DoorLockDevice).first().events(DoorLock)
    ```
3.  **For all available events for the object:**
    ```kotlin
    val eventflow = homeDevice.type(DoorLockDevice).first().events()
    ```
Consume events from the flow using `collect()`:
```kotlin
eventflow.collect { event ->
  if (event != null) {
    logger.atInfo().log("Received event %s", event)
    // do something
  }
}
```
## Subscribing to Entity Relation Events
You can listen for events when an entity (structure, room, device, automation) is added, removed, or updated. These events are instances of [`HomeObjectChangeEvent`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HomeObjectChangeEvent) and contain the ID of the changed entity.
> **Note:** These events originate from the Device and Structure APIs, not as Matter events.
To get an event stream, call the [`stream()`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HomeObjectsFlow#stream()) method on the [`HomeObjectsFlow<T>`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HomeObjectsFlow) from the corresponding flow method:
| Entity | Interface | Flow Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`Structure`](/apis/android/device/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/Structure) | [`HasStructures`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasStructures) | [`structures()`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasStructures#structures()) |
| [`Room`](/apis/android/device/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/Room) | [`HasRooms`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasRooms) | [`rooms()`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasRooms#rooms()) |
| [`HomeDevice`](/apis/android/device/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HomeDevice) | [`HasHomeDevices`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasHomeDevices) | [`devices()`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasHomeDevices#devices()) |
| [`Automation`](/apis/android/device/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/Automation) | [`HasAutomations`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasAutomations) | [`automations()`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/HasAutomations#automations()) |
Example of handling device changes:
```kotlin
val devicesStream = home.devices().stream()
// Collect and react to device changes.
devicesStream.collect { deviceEvent ->
  when (deviceEvent) {
    is HomeObjectAddedEvent ->
      println("New device now available with id: ${deviceEvent.id}")
    is HomeObjectUpdatedEvent -> println("Device ${deviceEvent.id} has been updated")
    is HomeObjectRemovedEvent -> println("Device is removed from your account")
    else -> {}
  }
}
```

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/device/remove

# Remove a device
Removing (decommissioning) a device from a structure can be done via the Google Home app (GHA) or programmatically by an app using the Home APIs. This action has limitations and can affect the entire structure and user experience.
## Removable Devices
An app can programmatically remove:
*   **Matter devices** for which the app has permissions.
*   **Matter bridges**, provided the app has access to all devices connected through it. Removing the bridge also removes all its connected devices.
## Non-Removable Devices
The Home APIs **cannot** be used to programmatically remove:
*   Matter devices for which the app lacks user permissions.
*   Individual devices connected behind a Matter bridge.
*   Cloud-to-cloud linked devices.
*   Dual-path devices (implementing both Matter and Cloud-to-cloud).
## Important Considerations
Removing a device affects all users and apps in the structure, including the GHA.
*   **Multi-function Devices**: Removing a device with multiple functions (e.g., a smart light that is also a hub) will also remove all associated devices. The app should inform the user.
*   **Device History**: The device's history may be deleted.
*   **Shared Surfaces**: Deleting devices on shared surfaces can have unintended consequences for other users.
*   **Authentication**: Device removal must be performed on authenticated surfaces (e.g., a mobile phone) and not on unauthenticated ones (e.g., a TV), per [Google Home Developer Policies](/policies).
## How to Remove a Device
### 1. Check Eligibility (Optional)
Checking a device's removal eligibility is a resource-intensive, high-latency operation and should only be done when necessary to avoid impacting UI responsiveness.
```kotlin
val eligibility = device.checkDecommissionEligibility()
if (eligibility is DecommissionEligibility.Ineligible) {
  println("The device cannot be decommissioned.")
} else if (eligibility is DecommissionEligibility.EligibleWithSideEffects) {
  println("The device can be decommissioned but there will be side effects on other devices.")
} else if (eligibility is DecommissionEligibility.Eligible) {
  println("The device can be decommissioned.")
}
```
### 2. Remove the Device
#### Matter Devices
A Matter device can be removed programmatically if it is not behind a Matter bridge.
*   **To remove**, call `decommissionDevice()`:
    ```kotlin
    val decommissionedDeviceIds = device.decommissionDevice()
    ```
    A successful call does not throw an error.
*   **To verify**, check if the device ID is in the returned list:
    ```kotlin
    if (decommissionedDeviceIds.contains(deviceId)) {
      println("Decommission successful!")
    } else {
      println("Decommission failed!")
    }
    ```
#### Non-Matter Devices
Non-Matter devices **cannot** be removed programmatically.
*   Calling `decommissionDevice()` on a non-Matter device throws a `HomeException`.
*   To remove them, you must issue a [Sync request](/cloud-to-cloud/integration/request-sync) or [delete the Cloud-to-cloud integration](/cloud-to-cloud/on-hold/launch/delete).
*   **To verify** removal, confirm the device is no longer present by attempting to retrieve it:
    ```kotlin
    var removedDevice: HomeDevice? = null
    runBlockingCustom {
      try {
        removedDevice = homeManager.devices().get(deviceId)
      } catch (exception: Exception) {
        println("removal successful!")
      }
    }
    if (removedDevice != null) {
      println("removal failed!")
    }
    ```

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/device/trait-index

# Trait Index on Android
This index helps determine a trait's name from its ID, which is often the only information available in log messages.
Each trait has a unique ID containing a four-digit string corresponding to the Matter Vendor ID (VID):
*   `0000`: **Matter Standard VID** - The trait is derived from a Matter cluster.
*   `6006`: **Google VID** - The trait is derived from a Google smart home trait.
For example, `home.matter.0000.clusters.0508` is the Matter trait `LowPower`, and `home.matter.6006.clusters.fc2f` is the Google trait `OpenClose`.
For additional information, see [Traits](/apis/android/data-model#traits).

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/manufacturer-specific-traits

# Manufacturer-specific traits on Android
The Home APIs for Android support Manufacturer-specific (MS) traits, which allow for functionality beyond standard Matter traits. MS traits must be defined in the standard `.matter` IDL format and then converted into an Android package using the Google-provided code generator. Provisional traits can also be generated.
**Note:** The term *trait* in the Home APIs is equivalent to *cluster* in the Matter Specification.
### Prerequisites
*   A Linux-based machine with Python 3.10 or newer.
*   A `.matter` IDL file with your `client cluster` definitions.
    *   For more about the IDL format, see [matter/idl on GitHub](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/scripts/py_matter_idl/matter/idl).
    *   The complete IDL for all standard Matter clusters is at [controller-clusters.matter](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/src/controller/data_model/controller-clusters.matter).
### Generate a package
[Download the Packaged Code Generator](/static/apis/matter/matter_codegen.tar.gz)
1.  Choose a Java package name that aligns with your app's Application ID (e.g., `com.mycompany.matter.cluster`).
2.  Extract and set up the generator:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/tmp/codegen_test
    cd ~/tmp/codegen_test
    tar xfvz ~/tmp/matter_codegen.tar.gz
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the generator with your IDL file:
    ```bash
    ./codegen.py \
      --generator custom:.:kotlin \
      --output-dir ./generated/com/mycompany/matter/cluster \
      --option package:com.mycompany.matter.cluster \
      custom-cluster-idl.matter
    ```
### Use the package
Import the generated package into your app to use the MS traits like standard traits.
```kotlin
import com.mycompany.matter.cluster
// Example: Accessing an MS trait named 'CustomTrait'
val device = devices().get(id)?
val deviceType = devices().get(id)?.type?.value
val trait = device?.type(deviceType)?.map{it.trait(CustomTrait)}.firstOrNull()
```
### Additional dependencies
You may need to add the following to your app's `build.gradle` file:
```groovy
implementation 'com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations:2.35.1'
```
### Example
#### IDL input
A simple MS trait defined in `mycustom.matter`. The trait ID `4294048768` (`0xFFF1FC00`) uses a test Vendor ID (`0xFFF1`) and a manufacturer-specific suffix (`0xFC00`), as per the Matter Specification's *Manufacturer Extensible Identifier (MEI)* section.
```idl
// mycustom.matter
client cluster MyCustom = 4294048768 {
    attribute int16u clusterAttr = 1;
    // Global Attributes
    readonly attribute command_id generatedCommandList[] = 65528;
    readonly attribute command_id acceptedCommandList[] = 65529;
    readonly attribute event_id eventList[] = 65530;
    readonly attribute attrib_id attributeList[] = 65531;
    readonly attribute bitmap32 featureMap = 65532;
    readonly attribute int16u clusterRevision = 65533;
}
```
#### Run the code generator
```bash
./codegen.py \
  --generator custom:.:kotlin \
  --output-dir ./generated/com/mycompany/matter/cluster \
  --option package:com.mycompany.matter.cluster \
  mycustom.matter
```
#### Kotlin output
The generator creates two Kotlin files, `MyCustom.kt` and `MyCustomTrait.kt`, in the specified output directory. These files contain the generated interfaces, classes, and serialization logic for the `MyCustomTrait`, formatted for use with the Home APIs. Once imported into your project, they can be used as described in the "Use the package" section.

# Automation API on Android Overview
Automations, previously known as Routines in the Google Home app (GHA) and the web script editor, are now available via the Home APIs for Android. They use the same core concepts but offer enhanced features:
*   Access to all Matter standard and smart home device traits presented in the Home APIs.
*   Support for sequential, parallel, and select execution flows.
Automations are written using **Automation DSL**, a domain-specific language for Kotlin.
**Note:**
*   **Trait Support:** Support may be limited to specific attributes, events, and commands for a given trait. See [Automation API trait support on Android](/apis/android/automation/supported-traits) for a complete list.
*   **Initialization:** All traits and types used with the Device, Structure, or Automation APIs must be registered at initialization. See [Initialize the home on Android](/apis/android/initialize).
*   **Permissions:** If a user revokes full permissions, all automations will stop working without notifying the developer. Revoking access to specific devices will cause associated starters, conditions, and actions to fail.
## Developer Journey
Integrating the Automation API follows the integration of the Structure and Device APIs.
1.  Plan and define the automation using Automation DSL.
2.  Embed the definition in a Kotlin Android app.
3.  The app presents automations to the user based on device info (traits, attributes, etc.) gathered from the Discovery API or Device API.
    *   The **Discovery API** is optimized for generating customized draft automations.
    *   The **Device API** provides similar data but is less optimized for this use case. See [Compare the Device API and Discovery API](/apis/automation/discovery#compare_the_device_api_and_discovery_api).
4.  The app creates the automation instance, keyed to the selected structure.
5.  The automation is now available in the user's structure and can be managed (executed, deleted) using Structure API methods.
Your app can offer predefined automations, customizable templates, or a full editor for users to build complex automations. Each time a user sets up an automation, a new instance is created.
## Resource Limits
The following limits apply to automations in the Home APIs and are subject to change.
| Metric | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Max automations per structure | 64 |
| Max nodes per automation | 128 |
| Max expression nodes per automation | 64 |
| Max automation instances per structure | 1024 |
| Max automation instances per developer per structure | 64 |
| Max executions per structure per day | 1024 |
| Max executions per developer per structure per day | 128 |

# Design an Automation on Android
**Important Considerations:**
*   All household members can see when automations run.
*   Automations are for convenience, not for safety or security-critical use cases. Do not create automations where failure could result in injury or harm.
*   Functionality depends on a working internet connection, Wi-Fi, and service availability from both Google and third-party device manufacturers.
*   Google is not responsible for any harm or losses from failed automations.
## Design Parameters
Before building an automation, determine the following:
*   **Suggestion Context:** The circumstances under which the automation should be suggested to the user (e.g., after adding three new lights).
*   **Required Device Types:** The specific devices needed (e.g., `OnOffLightDevice`, `DimmableLightDevice`).
*   **Required Traits & Commands:** The necessary traits, attributes, and commands, ensuring they are [supported by the Automation API](/apis/android/automation/supported-traits).
*   **Starters:** The traits that will activate the automation.
*   **Conditions & Actions:** Additional conditions that determine if the automation should run and which actions to perform.
*   **Execution Flow:** Whether the automation should execute sequentially or in parallel, and if multiple logic paths are needed.
**Note:** It's helpful to diagram the automation's flow. The automation you build is a "template" populated with the user's specific structures and devices when they adopt it.
## Automation Examples
See the [Build an automation](/apis/android/automation/build#code_examples) page for code examples.
### Simple Automation: Raise Blinds at 8:00 AM
1.  **Gather Devices:** Use the Discovery API to get a list of `WindowCoveringDevice` devices.
2.  **Verify Address:** Ensure the user's structure has a street address in the Google Home app for time zone accuracy. If not, notify the user and halt.
3.  **Define Automation:**
    *   **Starter:** Time is 8:00 AM.
    *   **Action:** For each blind, call the `WindowCovering` trait's `upOrOpen` command.
### Complex Automation: Blink Lights on Motion
1.  **Gather Devices:** Use the Discovery API to get a list of light devices (e.g., `OnOffLightDevice`, `ColorTemperatureLightDevice`).
2.  **User Selection:** Allow the user to select which lights should blink.
3.  **Define Automation:**
    *   **Starter:** Monitor `AreaPresenceState` for someone arriving or leaving.
    *   **Condition:** If `presenceState` indicates the structure is occupied.
    *   **Action:** Blink the selected lights.
### Generic Automation: User-Guided Creation
This automation guides a user through creating a custom automation using any of their devices.
1.  The user selects a structure.
2.  The app displays all rooms and devices, allowing the user to see available starters and commands for each.
3.  The user assembles the automation by choosing devices, starters, and commands.
4.  The app generates and saves the automation to the chosen structure.
This requires data from several Home APIs:
| API | Information Provided |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Structure API** | Available structures and the rooms within them. |
| **Device API** | Devices within a chosen structure and their location (room). |
| **Discovery API** | Supported device traits, available starters/commands, and constraints on command parameters. |

# Build an Automation on Android
Automation APIs are accessed via the Home APIs for Android. You must first get user permission for a `Structure` before using them.
Once permissions are granted, import the necessary packages:
```kotlin
import com.google.home.Home
import com.google.home.HomeDevice
import com.google.home.Id
import com.google.home.Structure
import com.google.home.automation.*
// ... and other specific packages as needed
```
A `Structure` contains the [`HasAutomations`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/automation/HasAutomations) interface with these methods:
| API | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `automations()` | Lists all automations belonging to the structure that were created via the Home APIs. |
| `createAutomation(automation)` | Creates an automation instance for a structure. |
| `deleteAutomation(automationId)` | Deletes an automation instance by its ID. |
> **Caution:** Code examples may be implemented differently than in sample apps to illustrate basic API calls.
## Create an Automation
First, get the structure and device(s):
```kotlin
val structure = homeManager.structures().list().single()
val device = homeManager.devices().get(Id("myDevice"))!!
```
Define the automation's logic using the Automation DSL. An automation is represented by the `Automation` interface, which has properties for metadata (name, description), flags (`isActive`), and the automation logic graph (`automationGraph`). The `DraftAutomation` interface is used for building and creating automations.
Here's an automation that turns `device2` on when `device1` is turned on:
```kotlin
val automation: DraftAutomation = automation {
  name = "MyFirstAutomation"
  description = "Turn on a device when another device is turned on."
  // isActive defaults to true
  sequential {
    val starterNode = starter<_>(device1, OnOffLightDevice, trait=OnOff)
    condition { expression = starterNode.onOff equals true }
    action(device2, OnOffLightDevice) { command(OnOff.on()) }
  }
}
// Pass the DraftAutomation to create it
val createdAutomation = structure.createAutomation(automation)
```
### Validation Errors
If creation fails validation, a warning or error message will describe the issue. See [`ValidationIssueType`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/automation/ValidationIssueType) for details.
## Code Examples
### Simple Automation
Raise the blinds at 8:00 AM daily.
```kotlin
// Check if scheduling is supported and blinds exist
val allCandidates = structure.allCandidates().first()
val isSchedulingSupported = allCandidates.any {
    it is EventCandidate && it.eventFactory == Time.ScheduledTimeEvent && it.unsupportedReasons.isEmpty()
}
val blinds = allCandidates
    .filter { it is CommandCandidate && it.commandDescriptor == WindowCoveringTrait.UpOrOpenCommand }
    .map { it.entity }.filterIsInstance<HomeDevice>().filter { it.has(WindowCoveringDevice) }
if (isSchedulingSupported && blinds.isNotEmpty()) {
  val automation: DraftAutomation = automation {
    name = "Day time open blinds"
    description = "Open all blinds at 8AM everyday"
    sequential {
      // At 8:00am local time...
      starter(structure, Time.ScheduledTimeEvent) {
        parameter(Time.ScheduledTimeEvent.clockTime(LocalTime.of(8, 0, 0, 0)))
      }
      // ...open all the blinds
      parallel {
        for (blind in blinds) {
          action(blind, WindowCoveringDevice) { command(WindowCovering.upOrOpen()) }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  val createdAutomation = structure.createAutomation(automation)
}
```
### Complex Automation
Blink lights when motion is detected.
```kotlin
// Get available lights and let user select them
val availableLights = ...
val selectedLights = ... // user selects one or more lights
automation {
  isActive = true
  sequential {
    // If the presence state changes...
    val starterNode = starter<_>(structure, AreaPresenceState)
    // ...and if the area is occupied...
    condition {
      expression = starterNode.presenceState equals PresenceState.PresenceStateOccupied
    }
    // "blink" the light(s) by toggling them with delays
    parallel {
      for(light in selectedLights) {
        action(light, OnOffLightDevice) { command(OnOff.toggle()) }
        delayFor(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
        action(light, OnOffLightDevice) { command(OnOff.toggle()) }
        delayFor(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
        action(light, OnOffLightDevice) { command(OnOff.toggle()) }
        delayFor(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
        action(light, OnOffLightDevice) { command(OnOff.toggle())}
      }
    }
  }
}
```
## Dynamically Select Devices with Entity Filters
Entity filters allow automations to select devices at runtime based on criteria like device type or room.
To use them, call `atExecutionTime()` on a `Structure` or `Room`, then call [`getDevicesOfType()`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/automation/GetDevicesOfType).
**Example:** Trigger an automation when *any* `OnOffLightDevice` is used.
```kotlin
val starter = starter(
  entityExpression = structure.atExecutionTime().getDevicesOfType(OnOffLightDevice),
  trait = OnOff,
)
```
**Example:** Turn off all lights except the hall light when any light is turned off.
```kotlin
automation {
  sequential {
    // If any light is turned on or off
    val starter = starter(
        entityExpression = structure.atExecutionTime().getDevicesOfType(OnOffLightDevice),
        trait = OnOff,
    )
    // Check if the triggering light was turned off
    condition { expression = starter.onOff equals false }
    // Turn off all lights except the hall light
    action(
      entityExpression = structure.atExecutionTime().getDevicesOfType(OnOffLightDevice)
        .filter { it notEquals entity(hallwayLight, OnOffLightDevice) }
    ) {
      command(OnOff.on())
    }
  }
}
```
**Runtime Behavior:**
| Scenario | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| No devices meet criteria in a starter. | The automation doesn't trigger. |
| No devices meet criteria in a state reader. | The automation starts but does nothing. |
| No devices meet criteria in an action. | The action does nothing. |
## Execute and Stop an Automation
*   **Execute**: Run an automation with `createdAutomation.execute()`. If the automation has a [manual starter](/apis/android/automation/dsl/basic#manual_starter), execution begins there. Otherwise, it starts after the first starter node.
*   **Stop**: Stop a running automation with `createdAutomation.stop()`.
Both methods may throw a `HomeException` on failure. See [Error handling](/apis/android/error-handling).
## Manage Automations
### List Automations for a Structure
Collect a `Flow` of automations from a structure.
```kotlin
structure.automations().collect { automationsList ->
  for (automation in automationsList) {
    println("${automation.id}: ${automation.name}")
  }
}
```
### Get an Automation by ID
Filter the list of automations by ID.
```kotlin
val automation = structure.automations().mapNotNull {
  it.firstOrNull { automation -> automation.id == Id("automation-id") }
}.firstOrNull()
```
### Get an Automation by Name
Filter the list by name.
```kotlin
val automation = structure.automations().filter {
  it.name.equals("Sunset Blinds")
}
```
### Get All Automations for a Device
Scan each automation's graph to find nodes that reference a specific device ID.
```kotlin
fun collectDescendants(node: Node): List<Node> {
  val descendants: MutableList<Node> = mutableListOf(node)
  val children: List<Node> = when (node) {
      is SequentialFlow -> node.nodes
      is ParallelFlow -> node.nodes
      is SelectFlow -> node.nodes
      else -> emptyList()
  }
  for (c in children) { descendants += collectDescendants(c) }
  return descendants
}
val myDeviceId = "device@452f78ce8-0143-84a-7e32-1d99ab54c83a"
val automationsForDevice = structure.automations().first().filter { automation ->
    collectDescendants(automation.automationGraph!!).any { node ->
      when (node) {
        is Starter -> node.entity.id.id == myDeviceId
        is StateReader -> node.entity.id.id == myDeviceId
        is Action -> node.entity.id.id == myDeviceId
        else -> false
      }
    }
}
```
> **Note:** `structure.automations()` only lists automations created by your app.
## Update an Automation
Update an automation's metadata using its [`update()`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/Updatable#update(kotlin.method1,kotlin.method1)) method.
```kotlin
automation.update { this.name = "Flashing lights 2" }
```
To change an automation's logic, you must replace the entire `automationGraph`. Per-node editing is not supported.
```kotlin
automation.update {
  this.automationGraph = sequential {
    // ... new automation logic ...
    action(speaker, SpeakerDevice) { command(AssistantBroadcast.broadcast("laundry is done")) }
  }
}
```
> **Key Point:** Updating an automation creates a new, immutable instance and overwrites the original. Avoid maintaining references to old automation instances; always get the latest from the `structure.automations()` collection.
## Delete an Automation
Delete an automation by its ID using the structure's [`deleteAutomation()`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/automation/HasAutomations#deleteAutomation(com.google.home.Id)) method.
```kotlin
structure.deleteAutomation(automation.id)
```
This may throw a `HomeException` on failure.
## Impact of Device Deletion
If a device used in an automation is deleted, the automation will be affected. It may fail to trigger (if the device was in a starter) or fail to execute actions involving that device.

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/automation/discovery

# Android Device Discovery API
The Discovery API for Android allows apps to discover devices, traits, commands, attributes, events, and their valid value ranges within a user's home structure to create automations. It automatically ignores devices and traits that are unsupported by the Automation API or not registered in the `FactoryRegistry`.
### Warnings
*   **State Reporting:** Not all devices reliably report state changes. The API filters some known problematic devices, but it is not infallible. Devices that don't report state changes reliably should not be used as automation starters.
*   **Performance:** API calls can be resource-intensive and latent. Avoid impacting UI responsiveness.
*   **Transaction Limits:**
    *   Home APIs < 1.0.1 & Play Services <= 25.02.34: `android.os.TransactionTooLargeException` may occur with 50 or more devices.
    *   Home APIs >= 1.1.0 & Play Services >= 25.03.32: May return no candidates with more than 200 devices.
## Using the API
The core of the API is the `HasCandidates` interface, which is the root for `Structure`, `Room`, and `HomeDevice`.
*   **Methods:**
    *   `candidates()`: Returns a `Flow` with a one-time snapshot of automation candidates for the entity.
    *   `allCandidates()`: Returns candidates for the entity and all its children (not supported by `Room`).
*   **Data Freshness:** To get the latest list, you must call `candidates()` or `allCandidates()` again. Calling more than once per minute returns cached data.
*   **Candidate Types:** The methods return a `NodeCandidate`, which is the root for interfaces like `ActionCandidate`, `StarterCandidate`, `StateReaderCandidate`, and classes like `CommandCandidate`, `EventCandidate`, and `TraitAttributesCandidate`.
## Automation Candidate Examples
### Example 1: Timed Automation (Close Blinds)
This example finds an event candidate for a scheduled time and a command candidate to close window coverings, then creates an automation.
```kotlin
import com.google.home.Structure
import com.google.home.automation.CommandCandidate
import com.google.home.automation.EventCandidate
import com.google.home.automation.Automation
import com.google.home.automation.DraftAutomation
import com.google.home.platform.Time
import java.time.LocalTime
import com.google.home.matter.standard.WindowCoveringTrait
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.first
import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking
fun createAutomationWithDiscoveryApiTimeStarter(
  structureName: String,
  scheduledTimeInSecond: Int,
): String = runBlocking {
  val structure = homeClient.structures().findStructureByName(structureName)
  val clockTimeStarter = structure.allCandidates().first().firstOrNull {
      it is EventCandidate && it.eventFactory == Time.ScheduledTimeEvent
  } as? EventCandidate
  val downOrCloseCommand = structure.allCandidates().first().firstOrNull {
      it is CommandCandidate && it.commandDescriptor == WindowCoveringTrait.DownOrCloseCommand
  } as? CommandCandidate
  // prompt user to select the WindowCoveringDevice
  val blinds = ...
  if (clockTimeStarter != null && downOrCloseCommand != null && blinds != null) {
    val draftAutomation: DraftAutomation = automation {
      name = ""
      description = ""
      isActive = true
      sequential {
        starter<_>(structure, Time.ScheduledTimeEvent) {
          parameter(Time.ScheduledTimeEvent.clockTime(LocalTime.ofSecondOfDay(scheduledTimeInSecond.toLong())))
        }
        action(blinds, WindowCoveringDevice) { command(WindowCoveringTrait.downOrClose()) }
      }
    }
    val automation = structure.createAutomation(draftAutomation)
    return@runBlocking automation.id.id
  } else {
    // The automation cannot be created
  }
}
```
### Example 2: State-Based Automation (Dim Light)
This example creates an automation to set a light's brightness level when it is turned on.
```kotlin
import com.google.home.Structure
import com.google.home.automation.CommandCandidate
import com.google.home.automation.TraitAttributesCandidate
import com.google.home.automation.Automation
import com.google.home.automation.DraftAutomation
import com.google.home.matter.standard.LevelControl
import com.google.home.matter.standard.LevelControlTrait.MoveToLevelCommand
import com.google.home.matter.standard.OnOff
import com.google.home.matter.standard.OnOff.Companion.onOff
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.first
import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking
import com.google.home.automation.equals
fun createAutomationWithDiscoveryApiDimLight(structureName: String): String = runBlocking {
  val structure: Structure = homeClient.structures().findStructureByName(structureName)
  val allCandidates = structure.allCandidates().first()
  val dimmableLightDevice = structure.devices().list().first { it.has(OnOff) && it.has(LevelControl) }
  val starterCandidate = allCandidates.filterIsInstance<TraitAttributesCandidate>()
      .firstOrNull { it.entity == dimmableLightDevice && it.trait == OnOff }
  val actionCandidate = allCandidates.filterIsInstance<CommandCandidate>()
      .firstOrNull { it.entity == dimmableLightDevice && it.commandDescriptor == MoveToLevelCommand }
  if (starterCandidate != null && actionCandidate != null) {
    val draftAutomation: DraftAutomation = automation {
      sequential {
        val starter = starter<_>(dimmableLightDevice, OnOffLightDevice, OnOff)
        condition { expression = starter.onOff equals true }
        action(dimmableLightDevice, DimmableLightDevice) {
          mapOf(MoveToLevelCommand.Request.CommandFields.level to 55u.toUByte())
        }
      }
    }
    val automation = structure.createAutomation(draftAutomation)
    return@runBlocking automation.id.id
  } else {
    // The automation cannot be created
  }
}
```
## Verifying Attribute Capabilities
Not all trait attributes can be used as a starter or be modified. To check an attribute's capabilities:
1.  Get the `TraitAttributesCandidate` for the desired trait.
2.  Access its `fieldDetailsMap()` to get a map of `AttributeDetails` instances.
3.  Check the properties of the specific `AttributeDetails` instance:
    *   `isSubscribable()`: Determines if the attribute can be used as a starter.
    *   `isModifiable()`: Determines if the attribute can be updated.
## Checking for Prerequisites
The API reports missing prerequisites via the `NodeCandidate.unsupportedReasons()` attribute, which contains `UnsupportedCandidateReason` objects.
*   **Example Reasons:**
    *   `MissingStructureAddressSetup`: Required for the `Time` trait. Prompt the user to set the address in the Google Home app (GHA).
    *   `MissingPresenceSensingSetup`: Required for `AreaPresenceState` and `AreaAttendanceState` traits.
    *   `MissingSubscription`: A [Nest Aware](https://store.google.com/product/nest_aware) subscription is required for the `ObjectDetection` trait.
### Handling Missing Prerequisites
```kotlin
val structure = homeManager.structures().list().single()
val allCandidates = structure.allCandidates().list().single()
val scheduledStarterCandidate = allCandidates.first { it is EventCandidate && it.eventFactory == ScheduledTimeEvent }
if (scheduledStarterCandidate.unsupportedReasons.any { it is MissingStructureAddressSetup }) {
  showToast("No Structure Address setup. Redirecting to GHA to set up an address.")
  launchChangeAddress(...)
}
```
## Validating Parameters with Constraints
The API provides allowed values for attributes and parameters using `Constraint` instances, which helps validate user input.
### Constraint Types
| Constraint class | Properties representing accepted values |
| :--- | :--- |
| `BitmapConstraint` | `combinedBits` |
| `BooleanConstraint` | (none) |
| `ByteConstraint` | `maxLength`, `minLength` |
| `EnumConstraint` | `allowedSet` |
| `NumberRangeConstraint` | `lowerBound`, `upperBound`, `step`, `unit` |
| `NumberSetConstraint` | `allowedSet`, `unit` |
| `StringConstraint` | `allowedSet`, `disallowedSet`, `isCaseSensitive`, `maxLength`, `minLength`, `regex` |
| `StructConstraint` | `fieldConstraints` |
| `ListConstraint` | `elementConstraint` |
### Using Constraints
This example checks if a value for a `LevelControl` attribute is within the bounds returned by the API.
```kotlin
import com.google.home.automation.CommandCandidate
import com.google.home.matter.standard.LevelControlTrait
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.first
// Find the CommandCandidate for the LevelControl trait's MoveToLevel command.
val levelCommand = structure.allCandidates().first().firstOrNull { candidate ->
    candidate is CommandCandidate && candidate.command == LevelControlTrait.MoveToLevelCommand
} as? CommandCandidate
var levelConstraint: NumberRangeConstraint? = null
// Retrieve the Constraint associated with the level parameter.
if (levelCommand != null) {
    levelConstraint = levelCommand.fieldDetailsMap[
        LevelControlTrait.MoveToLevelCommand.Request.CommandFields.level
    ]!!.constraint as? NumberRangeConstraint
}
// Test the value against the Constraint
if (levelConstraint != null && value in levelConstraint.lowerBound..levelConstraint.upperBound) {
   // ok to use the value
}
```
## Discovery API vs. Device API
While the Device API can also be used for discovery, it has limitations compared to the Discovery API.
### Device API Capabilities
*   Discover primary device types: `DeviceType.Metadata.isPrimaryType()`
*   Check for trait support on a device: `HasTraits.has()`
*   Check for attribute/command support on a trait: `supports()`
### Discovery API Advantages
*   **Automatic Filtering:** Filters out traits not supported by the Automation API.
*   **Value Constraints:** Provides valid value ranges for attributes and parameters, enabling input validation.

# Automation API Trait Support on Android
While the Automation API for Android supports most traits, some attributes, events, and commands may have limited support.
### General Rules & Limitations
*   **Registration:** All traits and types must be registered at initialization. See [Create a Home instance](/apis/android/initialize#create_a_home_instance).
*   **Usage:** Attributes can be used in starters or conditions. Commands can only be used as actions.
*   **Quality Thresholds:** Devices may be blocked from use due to [Report State](/cloud-to-cloud/integration/report-state) quality issues. The Discovery API automatically filters these devices out.
    *   **Starters:** Blocked if Report State success is < **90%**.
    *   **Actions:** Blocked if command execution success is < **95%**.
*   **Cloud-to-Cloud:** Devices that don't report their state cannot be used as automation triggers.
*   **API-Specific Traits:** Some traits, like [`AssistantBroadcast`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/google/AssistantBroadcast), are exclusive to the Automation API.
*   **`okGoogle` Command:** This is a structure-level command with specific [permission enforcement](/apis/android/permissions#okgoogle_permissions).
*   **Simplified Traits:** Simplified versions of some traits are available. See [Simplified traits on Android](/apis/android/automation/simplified-traits).
*   **Blocked Actions:** In the table below, `block` indicates a command is not supported for one or more device types. See [Blocked actions in automations on Android](/apis/android/automation/blocked-actions).
### Prerequisites
*   **`Time.ScheduledTimeEvent`**: The structure must have a street address set in the [Google Home app (GHA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app).
*   **`AreaPresenceState` / `AreaAttendanceState`**: The user must set up presence sensing in the GHA.
*   **`ObjectDetection`**: Requires an active [Nest Aware](https://store.google.com/product/nest_aware) subscription.

# Simplified Traits on Android
Simplified traits are facades for standard Home API traits, available for the Automation API on Android. They act as a device-specific subset of attributes and commands to simplify common tasks. They work for both Matter and Cloud-to-cloud devices.
**Example:**
*   The standard [`LevelControl`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/matter/standard/LevelControl) trait is generic for any device with a continuous numeric range.
*   The [`Brightness`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/google/Brightness) simplified trait stands in for `LevelControl` on a [`DimmableLight`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/matter/standard/DimmableLightDevice). It offers a simple `moveToBrightness(brightnessPercent)` command, whereas `LevelControl` has more complex `move` commands with more parameters.
### Simplified vs. Standard Traits
| Simplified trait | Standard trait(s) |
| --- | --- |
| [`SimplifiedThermostat`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/google/SimplifiedThermostat) | [`Thermostat`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/matter/standard/Thermostat) |
| [`Brightness`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/google/Brightness) | [`LevelControl`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/matter/standard/LevelControl) |
| [`SimplifiedOnOff`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/google/SimplifiedOnOff) | [`OnOff`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/matter/standard/OnOff) |
| [`Volume`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/google/Volume) | [`LevelControl`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/matter/standard/LevelControl) [`OnOff`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/matter/standard/OnOff) |
### Discovery API
If both a simplified trait and its underlying standard trait are registered in the [`FactoryRegistry`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/FactoryRegistry), the Discovery API will report both. The developer can then choose which trait to use for automation.
### Retrieving a Device
To retrieve a device supporting a simplified trait (e.g., `SimplifiedThermostat`), you cannot use the `has(trait)` method. Instead, use the `has(deviceType)` method.
```kotlin
val thermostat = home.devices().list().first { device -> device.has(ThermostatDevice) }
```

# Android DSL Concepts
An overview of the fundamental concepts of the Automation DSL on Android.
## Automation Components
An automation consists of three basic components, evaluated in order:
1.  **Starter**: Defines the initial conditions that activate the automation (e.g., a trait change). A starter is mandatory.
2.  **Condition**: Additional constraints evaluated after activation. The expression must be `true` for actions to proceed.
3.  **Action**: Commands or state updates performed when all conditions are met.
**Example**: An automation dims the lights (**Action**) when the TV turns on (**Starter**), but only if the time is between sunset and sunrise (**Condition**).
Automations also contain metadata like **name** and **description**.
## Nodes
The logical structure of an automation consists of **nodes**, which are reusable units representing entity behaviors or execution flows. Nodes have input and output variables.
### Node Types
| Node | Node Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Starter** | Behavioral | Starts an automation when a trait's state changes. |
| **StateReader** | Behavioral | Reads a trait attribute to capture its value for use in condition nodes. |
| **Action** | Behavioral | Invokes trait command(s). |
| **Sequential** | Execution flow | Executes nested action nodes in sequence. This is the default behavior. |
| **Parallel** | Execution flow | Executes nested action nodes in parallel. |
| **Condition** | Execution flow | Conditionally changes execution flow based on the evaluation of logical expressions. |
| **Select** | Execution flow | Allows more than one starter to activate an automation. |
| **Expression** | Value | A trait's attribute value, a constant, or a literal. Must evaluate to a list, number, boolean, or string. |
### Execution Flow Nodes
- **Sequential Flow**: Executes nodes in sequential order (e.g., starter, condition, action).
- **Parallel Flow**: Executes multiple action nodes simultaneously. Nodes following a parallel flow wait for all parallel branches to finish.
- **Condition Flow**: Changes the execution path based on the evaluation of an expression (e.g., checking if it is nighttime).
- **Select Flow**: Allows an automation to be activated by any one of multiple starters.
    - **Important:** A `select` flow must be the first node in a `sequential` flow and cannot be placed in a `parallel` flow or nested within another `select` flow.
### Nested Flows
Execution flow nodes can be nested within each other for complex automations (e.g., a sequential flow that contains a parallel flow).
### Node Combination Rules
| Node | May contain the following | Must be within one of the following |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Starter** | Expression | Select, Sequential |
| **ManualStarter** | | Select, Sequential |
| **StateReader** | Expression (trait attribute value) | Action, Condition |
| **Action** | Command, Entity, Expression | Parallel, Select, Sequential |
| **Sequential** | Parallel, Select, Sequential | |
| **Parallel** | Action | Sequential |
| **Condition** | Expression | Parallel, Sequential |
| **Select** | Condition, Sequential, Starter, ManualStarter | Sequential (must be the first node) |
## Automation DSL
Automations are defined using the Automation DSL, a [Kotlin DSL](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html) that uses type-safe builders.
- It simplifies building automations and uses the same data model as Matter and smart home traits.
- It defines logic using abstract device types rather than specific device instances.
- When compiled, it generates Kotlin data classes that are serialized to protocol buffer JSON for Google's Automation Services.
### Example
An automation that turns on `light2` when `light1` is turned on.
```kotlin
val automation = automation {
  name = "MyFirstAutomation"
  description = "If light1 is on, turn on light2."
  isActive = true
  sequential {
    val onOffTrait = starter<_>(device1, OnOffLightDevice, OnOff)
    condition() { expression = onOffTrait.onOff equals true }
    action(device2, OnOffLightDevice) { command(OnOff.on()) }
  }
}
```

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/automation/dsl/basic

# Android DSL Guide
All automation DSL is placed within a single `automation` node, which forms the boundary between the outer Kotlin language context and the embedded DSL context.
## Sequential flow
The sequential flow is the default automation flow type.
![Sequential DSL example](/static/apis/images/apis-automation-dsl-sequential.svg)
A basic sequential flow consists of a starter, a condition, and an action:
```kotlin
import com.google.home.automation.action
import com.google.home.automation.automation
import com.google.home.automation.condition
import com.google.home.automation.sequential
import com.google.home.automation.starter
...
automation {
  sequential {
    starter<_>(...)
    condition {...}
    action {...}
  }
}
```
## Starter
Starter nodes define the initial circumstances that activate an automation. An automation must have at least one starter. To use multiple starters, you must use a `select` node.
### Starter based on trait attribute
Specify the device, the device type, and the trait. The device type is required to disambiguate which part of a composite device triggers the automation (e.g., a device with both `FanDevice` and `HeatingCoolingUnitDevice` traits).
```kotlin
starter<_>(thermostat, TemperatureSensorDevice, TemperatureMeasurement)
```
### Starter based on event
Specify the device, the device type, and the event.
```kotlin
starter<_>(doorBell, GoogleDoorbellDevice, DoorbellPressed)
```
### Starter based on a structure and event, with parameters
Some events require parameters. This example uses `Time.ScheduledTimeEvent` to activate the automation at 7:00 AM:
```kotlin
val earlyMorning = starter<_>(structure, Time.ScheduledTimeEvent) {
  parameter(Time.ScheduledTimeEvent.clockTime(
    LocalTime.of(7, 0, 0, 0)))
}
```
### Manual starter
A special starter that lets a user manually run the automation via a UI element calling `Automation.execute()`.
*   Do not specify a trait or device type.
*   In a `select` flow, a manual starter overrides other starters.
*   `condition` nodes following a manual starter are still evaluated and may block execution.
![Separating a manual starter from a conditional](/static/apis/images/apis-automation-dsl-select-manual-starter-vertical.svg)
To prevent `condition` nodes from blocking a manual start, place the conditional starter and its `condition` in a separate `sequential` block:
```kotlin
automation_graph {
  sequential {
    select {
      sequential {
        starter<_>(...)
        condition {...}
      }
      sequential {
        manualStarter()
      }
    }
    action {...}
  }
}
```
## Reference the value of an attribute
Use the value of an attribute in an expression via a `stateReader` or a `starter`.
**With a `stateReader`:**
```kotlin
val time = stateReader<_>(structure, Structure, Time)
val currTime = time.currentTime
```
**With a `starter`:**
```kotlin
val starterNode = starter<_>(device1, LaundryWasherDevice, OnOff)
condition() {
  expression = starterNode.onOff equals true
}
```
## Condition nodes and expressions
A `condition` node is a decision point. If its expression evaluates to `false`, the automation stops. You can use multiple `condition` nodes. Expressions are formed like Kotlin expressions and must evaluate to a single boolean value.
**Example of a complex expression:**
```kotlin
condition() {
  val expr1 = starterNode.lockState equals DlLockState.Unlocked
  val expr2 = stateReaderNode.lockState equals true
  val expr3 = occupancySensingDevice.occupied notEquals 0
  val expr4 = timeStateReaderNode
    .currentTime
    .between(
      timeStateReaderNode.sunsetTime,
      timeStateReaderNode.sunriseTime)
  expression = (expr1 and expr2) or (expr3 and expr4)
}
```
### stateReader
A `stateReader` node can be used to reference trait attribute values within a `condition`.
1.  **Define the `stateReader`:**
    ```kotlin
    import com.google.home.automation.stateReader
    ...
    val filterMonitoringState = stateReader<_>(structure, ActivatedCarbonFilterMonitoring)
    ```
2.  **Use it in a `condition`:**
    ```kotlin
    condition() {
      expression =
        filterMonitoringState.changeIndication
          .equals(ChangeIndicationEnum.Warning)
    }
    ```
3.  **Combine multiple `stateReaders`:**
    ```kotlin
    val armState = stateReader<_>(doorLock, DoorLockDevice, ArmDisarm )
    val doorLockState = stateReader<_>(doorLock, DoorLockDevice, DoorLock)
    condition() {
      expression =
        (armState.armState equals true)
        and
        (doorLockState.lockState equals true)
    }
    ```
### Condition duration
You can specify a duration (1 to 30 minutes) for which a condition's expression must be true.
```kotlin
condition {
  expression(lightStateReader.onOff == true)
  forDuration(Duration.ofMinutes(10))
}
```
## Action nodes
The `action` node executes the automation's task. This example invokes the `broadcast()` command of the `AssistantBroadcast` trait:
```kotlin
action(device, SpeakerDevice) {
  command(AssistantBroadcast.broadcast("Intruder detected!"))
}
```
## Import statements
*   **Trait attributes:** Import from the trait's `Companion` object.
    ```kotlin
    import com.google.home.matter.standard.OnOff.Companion.onOff
    ```
*   **Trait data structures:** Import from the trait class ending in `-Trait`.
    ```kotlin
    import com.google.home.matter.standard.MediaPlaybackTrait.PlaybackStateEnum
    ```
*   **Trait commands:** Import from the trait's `Companion` object.
    ```kotlin
    import com.google.home.matter.standard.Thermostat.Companion.setTemperatureSetpointHold
    ```

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/automation/dsl/complex

# Android DSL Guide for Complex Automations
The Automation DSL can create automations more complex than basic ones.
### Sequential with Multiple Actions
Multiple `action` nodes within a `sequential` block will run in order.
```kotlin
automation {
  sequential {
    starter<_>(...)
    condition {...}
    action {...}
    action {...}
    action {...}
  }
}
```
### Sequential with Multiple Parallel Actions
To run actions concurrently, place them inside a `parallel` block. Subsequent `action` nodes in the `sequential` block will wait for all parallel actions to complete. Using `parallel` is often preferred to avoid delays from sequential execution.
```kotlin
automation {
  sequential {
    starter<_>(...)
    condition {...}
    parallel {
      action {...}
      action {...}
      action {...}
    }
  }
}
```
### Delays
Use `delayFor(java.time.Duration)` to pause execution for a duration between 5 seconds and 24 hours.
**Warning:** `delayFor` must be in a `sequential` flow. It is ignored if nested within a `parallel` flow.
Example: Toggle a light four times with a five-second pause between each action.
```kotlin
sequential {
  action(light, OnOffLightDevice) { command(OnOff.toggle()) }
  delayFor(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
  action(light, OnOffLightDevice) { command(OnOff.toggle()) }
  delayFor(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
  action(light, OnOffLightDevice) { command(OnOff.toggle()) }
  delayFor(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
  action(light, OnOffLightDevice) { command(OnOff.toggle()) }
}
```
### Trigger Suppression
Use `suppressFor(java.time.Duration)` to prevent an automation from re-triggering for a specified period (5 seconds to 24 hours). This affects all `starter` nodes that precede it in the automation.
Example: After a motion trigger, ignore subsequent motion triggers for 30 minutes.
```kotlin
automation {
  sequential {
    val starterNode = starter<_>(device, OccupancySensor, MotionDetection)
    suppressFor(Duration.ofMinutes(30))
    action(light, OnOffLightDevice) { command(OnOff.toggle()) }
  }
}
```
### Limit the Number of Executions
Set the `maxExecutionCount` metadata field to limit how many times an automation can run. After reaching the limit, the automation is deleted, but its history remains in the Google Home app's **Activity** tab.
Example: An automation that can only execute once.
```kotlin
automation {
  // The automation can only be executed once.
  maxExecutionCount = 1
  // When the door lock state changes
  sequential {
    val doorLockEvent = starter<_>(doorLock, DoorLockDevice, LockOperationEvent)
    // if the door is unlocked
    condition() {
      expression = (doorLockEvent.lockOperationType equals LockOperationTypeEnum.Unlock)
    }
    // turn the light on
    action(light, DimmableLightDevice) { command(OnOff.on()) }
  }
}
```
### Set Trait Attributes in an Action
To set a trait attribute's value, use an `update(trait)` node within an `action`. Inside `update`, call a mutator function for each attribute you want to modify. The function name is formed by prefixing the capitalized attribute name with `set` (e.g., `defaultMoveRate` becomes `setDefaultMoveRate`).
**Important:** Only attributes with `write` access can be updated.
Example: Update two attributes for a Fan device.
```kotlin
action(device, Fan) {
  update(FanControl) {
    setPercentSetting(50u)
    setRockSetting(FanControlCluster.RockBitmap.rockUpDown)
  }
}
```

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/automation/dsl/recurring-starters

# Recurring Scheduled Event Starters
Three starters let you schedule an automation in advance:
*   [`Time.ScheduledTimeEvent`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/google/Time.ScheduledTimeEvent)
*   [`Time.RecurringClockTimeScheduledEvent`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/google/Time.RecurringClockTimeScheduledEvent)
*   [`Time.RecurringSolarTimeScheduledEvent`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/google/Time.RecurringSolarTimeScheduledEvent)
> **Note:** For these starters to work, the structure must have an address assigned via the [Google Home app (GHA)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app). See [Change Google home address](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7551002).
## `Time.ScheduledTimeEvent`
Schedules an automation for a single future instant or on a recurring basis, using either clock time or a solar event (sunrise/sunset).
**Clock Time Example:** Starts the automation at 10:00 PM every day.
```kotlin
starter<_>(structure, Time.ScheduledTimeEvent) {
  parameter(Time.ScheduledTimeEvent.clockTime(LocalTime.of(22, 0, 0, 0)))
}
```
**Solar Time Example:** Uses a [`SolarTimeStruct`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/google/TimeTrait.SolarTimeStruct) with a `type` (sunrise/sunset) and an `offset`. The following starts the automation 15 minutes before sunrise every day.
```kotlin
starter<_>(structure, Time.ScheduledTimeEvent) {
  parameter(
    Time.ScheduledTimeEvent.solarTime(
      SolarTimeStruct(SolarTimeType.Sunrise, java.time.Duration.ofMinutes(-15))
    )
  )
}
```
## Recurring Scheduled Event Starters
These starters, `RecurringClockTimeScheduledEvent` and `RecurringSolarTimeScheduledEvent`, create automations that run periodically with more specific time and calendar-based criteria.
### `cron` Expressions
These starters use a scheduling syntax similar to the Unix `cron` utility, specifically the [Quartz scheduler](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/) syntax. See the [Quartz `CronExpression` documentation](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/api/2.3.0/org/quartz/CronExpression.html) for details.
> **Important:** The **Second** field in `cron` expressions is strictly limited to numeric values from 0 to 59. A recurring event cannot trigger more often than once per minute.
#### Examples
| Use case | Second | Minute | Hour | Day-of-Month | Month | Day-of-Week | Year |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Run every 24 hours, at midnight | `0` | `0` | `0` | `?` | `*` | `*` | `*` |
| Run at 6:00am every Tuesday | `0` | `30` | `19` | `?` | `*` | `3` | `*` |
| Run at quarter past the hour, every hour, during February | `0` | `15` | `*` | `?` | `2` | `*` | `*` |
| Run once an hour | `0` | `0` | `*` | `?` | `*` | `*` | `*` |
| Run at midnight, Jan-Mar, on weekday closest to the 1st | `0` | `0` | `0` | `?` | `1-3` | `1W` | `*` |
| On the second Thursday of Feb, hourly at a quarter past | `0` | `15` | `*` | `?` | `2` | `5#2` | `*` |
| Run hourly at quarter past, on the last day of February | `0` | `15` | `*` | `L` | `2` | `?` | `*` |
| Run at 6:00am every Tuesday and Thursday | `0` | `30` | `19` | `?` | `*` | `3,5` | `*` |
### `RecurringClockTimeScheduledEvent`
Assigns a `cron` expression string to the [`cronExpression`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/google/Time.RecurringClockTimeScheduledEvent#cronExpression()) field.
**Example:** Starts the automation at 8:00 PM, every Wednesday in April.
```kotlin
starter<_>(structure, event = Time.RecurringClockTimeScheduledEvent) {
  parameter(Time.RecurringClockTimeScheduledEvent.cronExpression("0 0 20 ? 4 4 *"))
}
```
### `RecurringSolarTimeScheduleEvent`
This starter takes two parameters:
1.  A [`SolarTimeStruct`](/reference/kotlin/com/google/home/google/TimeTrait.SolarTimeStruct).
2.  `cronExpression`: A subset of a `cron` expression (Day-of-Month, Month, Day-of-Week, Year fields only).
**Example:** Starts an automation one hour after sunrise, every Wednesday in April.
```kotlin
starter<_>(structure, event = Time.RecurringSolarTimeScheduledEvent) {
  parameter(
    Time.RecurringSolarTimeScheduledEvent.solarTime(
      TimeTrait.SolarTimeStruct(SolarTimeType.Sunrise, Duration.ofHours(1))
    )
  )
  parameter(Time.RecurringSolarTimeScheduledEvent.cronExpression("? 4 4 *"))
}
```

# Source: https://developers.home.google.com/apis/android/automation/dsl/operators

# Android DSL Operator Reference
Operators allow you to check trait attributes, compare values, and combine expressions in `condition` nodes.
**Required imports:**
```kotlin
import com.google.home.automation.and
import com.google.home.automation.between
import com.google.home.automation.contains
import com.google.home.automation.equals
import com.google.home.automation.greaterThan
import com.google.home.automation.greaterThanOrEquals
import com.google.home.automation.lessThan
import com.google.home.automation.not
import com.google.home.automation.notEquals
import com.google.home.automation.or
```
## Comparison Operators
### `between`
Checks if a value is between two other values (inclusive).
*   `2` between `1` and `3` -> `true`
*   `6` between `1` and `3` -> `false`
```kotlin
val time = stateReader<_>(structure, Time)
condition() {
  expression = time.currentTime
     .between(
      time.sunsetTime,
      time.sunriseTime)
}
```
#### Using Dates with `between()`
You can specify a range of dates using `LocalDate`, or partial dates with `YearMonth`, `MonthDay`, or just the day of the month.
```kotlin
// Full dates
val exp2 =
  time.currentDate.between(
    LocalDate.of(2025, Month.OCTOBER, 1),
    LocalDate.of(2025, Month.DECEMBER, 15),
  )
// Year and month
val exp2 =
  time.currentDate.yearMonth.between(
    YearMonth.of(2024, Month.OCTOBER),
    YearMonth.of(2026, Month.JANUARY),
  )
// Month and day
val exp2 =

# Test your Home APIs app
Testing Home APIs apps presents unique challenges due to dependencies on physical smart home devices, network reliability, security, privacy, and device/protocol interoperability.
## Set up your test environment
*   **Dedicated Wi-Fi Network:** Isolate test devices on a dedicated Wi-Fi network to prevent interference and simulate various network conditions (e.g., throttled bandwidth).
*   **Diverse Devices:** Test with a variety of real, physical smart home devices from multiple manufacturers. Do not rely exclusively on virtual devices or emulators.
*   **Variety of Android Devices:** Test your app on Android devices from different manufacturers, with varying screen sizes and OS versions, to ensure broad compatibility.
## Assemble your tools
| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[Google Home Plugin for Android Studio]** | Access to Google Assistant Simulator, Home Graph Viewer, Google Cloud Logging, and adb Log viewer. |
| **[Google Home Playground]** | Useful for many testing scenarios, but not a substitute for physical devices. |
| **[Matter Virtual Device (MVD)]** | Emulation app for testing Matter devices. |
| [**Espresso**] | Automate UI testing. Requires mocking the underlying API to simulate hardware interactions. |
| A **Network emulator** | Simulate varying network conditions and API responses, especially for cloud-based Home APIs. |
| [**Android Studio Logcat**] | Handle and analyze log data. |
## Apply different testing approaches and strategies
In addition to standard user experience and security testing, focus on the following areas for Home APIs apps.
### Functional testing
1.  **Device Discovery and Pairing:** Test initial setup, re-discovery after app/device restarts or network changes, and failure scenarios (unresponsive devices, incorrect credentials).
2.  **State Synchronization:** Ensure the app accurately and promptly reflects the current device state.
3.  **Permissions:** Verify permission management and enforcement, especially for multiple users or shared access, including graceful handling of revoked permissions.
4.  **Scenes and Automations:** Test the creation, modification, and execution of scenes (e.g., "Goodnight") and automations, including starters and actions.
### Performance testing
*   **Responsiveness:** Verify the app is responsive and doesn't introduce unnecessary latency.
*   **Scalability:** Test with a large number of devices to assess performance under load.
*   **Resource Consumption:** Monitor CPU, memory, and battery usage to ensure it's reasonable, especially during active device communication.
### Reliability and stability testing
Test against the following scenarios:
1.  **Network Fluctuation:**
    *   Simulate Wi-Fi dropouts, weak signals, and network switching.
    *   Verify graceful handling of disconnections and reconnections.
    *   Check that commands queue and execute when connectivity is restored, or that appropriate error messages are shown.
    *   Test from remote networks, not just the local home network.
2.  **Device Disconnection:**
    *   Physically unplug devices.
    *   Power cycle devices.
3.  **Concurrent Operations:**
    *   Send a rapid sequence of commands.
    *   Have multiple users control the same device simultaneously.
    *   Test overlapping scenes and automations.
4.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Force API errors (e.g., by mocking cloud API server responses).
    *   Test invalid user input.
    *   Verify graceful degradation and informative error messages.
5.  **Long-Term Reliability:** Run the app and connected devices for extended periods to uncover memory leaks or stability issues.

# CommissioningClient
`interface CommissioningClient : HasApiKey, OptionalModuleApi`
Performs commissioning of Matter devices (both initial out of box commissioning, as well as multi-administrator commissioning flows).
## Public functions
### commissionDevice
`@RequiresApi(value = VERSION_CODES.O_MR1) fun commissionDevice(request: CommissioningRequest!): Task<IntentSender!>!`
Commission a new device into one or more fabrics. Devices commissioned using this API can later be managed from settings, using to launch a deeplink.
In the `CommissioningRequest`, if a commissioning service is specified via `setCommissioningService`, then this service will be bound and a commissioning request will be dispatched to this service after the device has been initially onboarded onto an operational network.
If you already know the particular device that you are looking for, then you can specify this via the `DeviceInfo` in the request to provide a hint as to which device will be set up during this commissioning process.
Alternatively, if you already have an onboarding payload for a device (i.e. a manual pairing code, or QR code string) you can specify this in the request via `setOnboardingPayload` to target a specific device, and bypass the need to scan a QR code or enter a manual pairing code during commissioning. Note that this API can be used either to perform initial onboarding of a device (including operational network configuration) as well as multi-admin commissioning for shared devices.
Upon success, the activity result will contain a `CommissioningResult` in the result data including details about the device which was commissioned. You can unpack the data using `fromIntentSenderResult`, providing the result code and result data.
If this is called when `SDK_INT` is lower than `O_MR1`, then the `Task` will fail with an `ApiException` with the status code `DEVELOPER_ERROR`.
### shareDevice
`@RequiresApi(value = VERSION_CODES.O_MR1) fun shareDevice(request: ShareDeviceRequest!): Task<IntentSender!>!`
Returns an IntentSender which can be used to display a sharing UI, which allows the user to grant administrative control of a Matter device to another user (via text) or application via Intent sharing to applications registered to receive the `ACTION_COMMISSION_DEVICE` intent action.
Upon receiving an IntentSender, it should be started for result. At this point, it is expected that the shared device already has an opened commissioning window, the details of which must be provided in the request.
If the user chooses a sharing destination, then the result will be RESULT_OK, and no further action should be taken (note that this does not mean that the user has commissioned the device -- only that the information has been sent elsewhere). Upon receiving a result of RESULT_CANCELED, it is recommended that you then revoke the opened commissioning window on the device.
If this is called when `SDK_INT` is lower than `O_MR1`, then the `Task` will fail with an `ApiException` with the status code `DEVELOPER_ERROR`.
### suppressHalfSheetNotification
`fun suppressHalfSheetNotification(): Task<Void!>!`
Disables proactive commissionable discovery notifications for Matter devices. If your application provides its own Matter discovery or commissioning flow, you may wish to suppress these notifications to prevent interruptions.
Notifications may be suppressed only while your application is in the foreground. Upon leaving the foreground, notifications will automatically be re-enabled.
Given this requirement, it is recommended that you disable notifications in your application process onStart() lifecycle method.
The suppression of the half sheet will be active for bounded time period. The default timeout 15 minutes."
